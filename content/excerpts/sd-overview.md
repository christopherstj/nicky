## The Project

Studio Delirium is currently in development at Crimson Herring Studios in partnership with Zugalu Entertainment. As the existing Narrative Director at Crimson Herring, I was introduced to this project by our game producer.

## My Role

Serving as **Narrative Director**, I'm responsible for the game's entire narrative architecture—from high-level story structure down to individual dialogue nodes.

### Design Responsibilities

- Worked with the Game Director and Producer to improve existing Game Design Documents
- Conducted meetings with real-life members of the industry (some NPCs are based on these individuals)
- Met regularly with the Game Director to plan and coordinate narrative work
- Planned quests, inventory items, and interactions to ensure narrative integration with gameplay systems
- Reviewed and revised deliveries from junior writers

### Writing Responsibilities

- Wrote branching dialogue using Articy:Draft
- Tested dialogue and gameplay within Unity, personally hooked up dialogues to Game Objects
- Responsible for the first-pass of the playable 'Golden Path' within Unity—ensuring the core narrative experience is solid before expanding branches

## Workflow Highlights

The attached workflow screenshots demonstrate my approach to dialogue architecture in Articy:Draft:

- **Variable Logic**: Conditional branching based on player stats, previous choices, and world state
- **Quest Progression**: Purple nodes indicate quest-dependent dialogue paths
- **Hub Design**: Centralized choice points tied to the player trait system
- **Broad Conversations**: Extended dialogue sequences that maintain engagement across lengthy scenes
