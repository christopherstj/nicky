## The Project

Sovereign Syndicate is a Disco Elysium-inspired RPG set in a Victorian steampunk London where magic and technology coexist uneasily. Players navigate a world of social stratification, supernatural creatures, and political intrigue through four distinct playable characters.

## My Role

I was hired as the **Lead Writer** for this project. As we gained funding—including a substantial grant from the Canada Media Fund—I relocated to Montreal to take on the role of **Narrative Director**.

### Design Responsibilities

- Drafted the story outline and worked closely with our Game Producer and Creative Director to bring the storyline to fruition
- Conducted period-specific research to ensure authentic Victorian atmosphere
- Created comprehensive development documents for NPCs, locations, and quests
- Vetted the hiring of junior writers and managed the narrative team
- Led bi-weekly meetings with the Narrative Team to track progress and maintain consistency

### Writing Responsibilities

- Responsible for branching dialogue across all four playable characters
- Designed questlines with meaningful player agency and consequence
- Ensured overall narrative cohesion across the entire game
- Tested dialogue and gameplay within Unity, personally hooking up dialogues to Game Objects
- Participated in QA and bug testing for the game overall

## Key Achievements

The game launched successfully on Steam, with particular praise for its writing quality and the depth of player choice. The Victorian setting's authenticity was noted by reviewers as a standout element.
