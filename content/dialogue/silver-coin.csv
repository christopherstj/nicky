You must stop the Howling Twins so that societies like mine can continue our work.""",Agree to Help,"You point out that werewolves, when properly self-regulated, deserve the same rights as any species.

"Thank you citizen. Your efforts shall not go unnoticed. In fact please accept this payment in advance." [Gain 150 Money]

I will seek supporters elsewhere."" You take your leave never to return."
