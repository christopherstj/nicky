My people have the numbers, the resources and the will to defeat the Republic of Texas Rangers. We lack only the right weapons.""|||INTUITION: Though his manner remains polite, the chill is palpable as Iron Bear finally takes a single long swallow of his whiskey.|||IRON BEAR: ""I know that I am asking you to interfere in Silas' business.

""I have it from a reliable source that Silas has developed a prototype for a steam-powered repeating-rifle. The real reason I've come to Europe is to arrange a shipment of rifles for the Comanche, but first I need the diagrams of this particular prototype."" You ask, ""Have you any idea where one might find these diagrams?"" Iron Bear's eyes dart around the room. ""Let's not discuss it now. I fear we are being observed. Meet me here this evening. I have an appointment with an Arsenal employee who might help me locate the diagrams. It'll be helpful if you join our conversation."""
