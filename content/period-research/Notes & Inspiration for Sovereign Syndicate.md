#### *Steam Power*

- ‘George Stephenson, (born June 9, 1781, Wylam, Northumberland, England—died August 12, 1848, Chesterfield, Derbyshire), was an English engineer and principal inventor of the railroad locomotive.’  
- ‘Following the sensational success of George Stephenson’s Rocket locomotive in 1829, Goldsworthy Gurney undertook to build a steam-powered road vehicle. In the carriage that he constructed he drove from London to Bath and returned at a speed of 24 km (15 miles) per hour; so well did it perform that he built several more and opened a passenger service. Powerful opposition to his invention arose at once among the horse-coach interests, and, although Gurney’s vehicles were not excessively heavy (1 1/2 to 2 1/2 tons), they were soon taxed out of existence. Gurney was knighted in 1863 as a result of an entirely different technical feat, that of improving the lighting and ventilation of the House of Commons.’ \- Brittanica.com  
- Sir Goldsworthy Gurney (1793-1875) \- “Built steam-powered carriages more than 50 years before gasoline automobiles were invented … Gurney Steamers reached up to 20mph … In 1829, the Gurney Steam Carriage Company served the route from London to Bath, averaging 14 miles per hour, including stops for water and fuel, nearly double the speed of a horse coach … Gurney tried various innovations to increase the power of his carriages, including a blast jet, which had the unfortunate effect of blowing cinders out of every orifice of the engine. With the huge pressures involved in the steam engine, passengers became uncomfortable sitting directly atop the boiler … On the Bath run one of his carriages was attacked by Luddites. According to Gurney’s daughter Anna, unemployed millworkers from Melksham set upon the carriage, “burnt their fingers, threw stones, and wounded poor Martyn the stoker,” forcing the carriage to be escorted the rest of the way under guard … **Gurney’s biggest rival was the railroad men. They lobbied authorities to hamper Gurney with prohibitive tolls levied on steam conveyances, while railroad developers were receiving government loans.** During the time of his experimentation, railroads grew from a single line of track to a 1,500 mile network. Eventually, stymied by the high tolls, Gurney’s steam carriage business fell apart and he turned his attention to lighthouses and mine ventilation.”  
- **Jill Lepore \- [These Truths](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/these-truths-a-history-of-the-united-states-pdf-6241893): A History of the United States** \- “That this invention would eventually upend political arrangements is prefigured in a likely apocryphal story told at the time about Watt and the king of England. When King George III went to a factory to see Watt’s engine at work, he was told that the factory was “manufacturing an article of which kings were fond.”8 What article is that, he asked? The reply: Power. There followed machine upon machine, steam-driven looms, steam-driven boats, making for faster production, faster travel, and cheaper goods. Steam-powered industrial production altered the economy, and it also altered social relations, especially between men and women and between the rich and the poor. **The anxiety and social dislocation produced by those changes fueled the revival of religion.** Everywhere, the flame of revival burned brightest in factory towns. Before the rise of the factory, home and work weren’t separate places. Most people lived on farms, where both men and women worked in the fields. In the winter, women spent most of their time carding, spinning and weaving wool, sheared from sheep. In towns and cities, shopkeepers and the masters of artisanal trades—bakers, tailors, printers, shoemakers—lived in their shops, where they also usually made their goods. They shared this living space with **journeymen** and apprentices. Artisans made things whole, undertaking each step in the process of manufacturing: a baker baked a loaf, a tailor stitched a suit. With the rise of the factory came the division of labor into steps done by different workers.9 With steam power, not only were the steps in the manufacturing process divided, but much of the labor was done by machines, which came to be known as “mechanical slaves.”10 New, steam-powered machines could also spin and weave—and even weave in ornate, multicolored patterns. In 1802, Joseph-Marie Jacquard, a French weaver, invented an automated loom. By feeding into his loom stiff paper cards with holes punched in them, he could instruct it to weave in any pattern he liked. Two decades later, the English mathematician Charles Babbage used Jacquard’s method to devise a machine that could “compute”; that is, it could make mathematical calculations. He called it the Difference Engine, a giant mechanical hand-cranked calculating machine that could tabulate any polynomial function. Then he invented another machine—he called it the Analytical Engine—that could apply the act of mechanical tabulation to solve any problem that involved logic. Babbage never built a working machine, but Ada Lovelace, a mathematician and the daughter of Lord Byron, later prepared a detailed description and analysis of the principles and promises of Babbage’s work, the first account of what would become, in the twentieth century, a general-purpose computer.”

#### *Jacquard Loom*

- Jacquard loom \- Jacquard figured out how to create a loop of punched cards so patterns could repeat. A Jacquard loom was destroyed in the public square in Lyon in 1806\. It didn’t stop progress \- by 1812, there were an amazing 18,000 Jacquard looms in France. Fashion anyone? Jacquard was awarded a lifetime pension by Napoleon and unlike anyone else in this story, Jacquard has a pattern named after him. Jacquard looms made their way to England in the 1820’s and by 1833, there were more than 100,000 working Power Looms. Surprise, surprise, not everyone was excited about this development. Disgruntled weavers in England burnt many a Jacquard loom. Others learned to shut them down by throwing a wooden shoe, known as a sabot in French, into the loom, and so became known as saboteurs. The Jacquard looms were the first mechanical computers used for commerce, as opposed to the Pascaline for finance.

#### *Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852\)* 

- An English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is believed by some to be the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of computers and one of the first computer programmers.  
- Augusta Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and his wife Lady Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later. He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child\! ADA\! sole daughter of my house and heart?".   
- “A mathematical genius and the first computer programmer, she became addicted to laudanum having been prescribed it for asthma.”  
- Lord Byron died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her eventual death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835\. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.  
- Ada King was Babbage’s assistant. Her status as Byron’s daughter was crucial in getting government funding. A few of his models were demonstrated, but like his Difference Engine, the Babbage Analytic Engine never actually worked. Still, he published many papers describing how the engine would operate if he built it. Much like the Jacquard loom, it had punch cards that contained the program and that would be fed into the Engine, which would run the program and spit out a result. This was the first idea for a stored-program computer but it would lay dormant until World War II. Babbage’s son played around with models of it late in the century that actually computed pi to 29 places; a carriage jammed while computing the 30th. The Analytic Engine, on paper anyway, was a decimal machine \- it did calculations using digits 0 through 9\.

#### *Victorian Parlour Games — Rules & Notes*

- “\[The 17th century was a\] century of contrasts: an ‘Age of Enlightenment’, but one which propagated slavery and colonial expansion; an age of industrial and technological innovation, but with a corresponding escalation in poverty and squalor. In this period of contradictions and inequality, it was the palliative effects of gambling that seemed to hold universal appeal. \[...\] The availability of luxuries increased at this time, as did a boom in the economy spurred by a diversifying trade system. This system allowed businesses to run on borrowed capital, which subsequently popularised the idea of speculation as a way of making profit. It is no wonder that a society addicted to luxury and speculation also institutionalised and glamorised gambling.”  
- Betting on Euchre \- Euchre is a trick taking game that's usually played with four players. The four players play as two teams. A normal game is played to 10 points, with one point awarded for naming trump and taking three or four tricks, two points awarded for naming trump and taking all five tricks, two points for taking three or more tricks when the other team names trump, and four points if you name trump, go alone, which means taking on your two opponents without the help of your partner, and taking all five tricks. The game involves a great deal of strategy, and your partner has as much influence on the outcome of the game as you do. It’s important to find a good partner if you want to gamble on euchre. You can bet on the outcome of a single game, a series of games, or you can bet a certain amount per point. I usually bet a set amount per point in a match to 10, with an additional amount per euchre. A euchre is when your opponents name trump and aren’t able to take at least three tricks.  
- *Piquet, casino, ombre, and quadrille, Nap—Napoleon*  
- “According to Hoyle,…” \[was a popular phrase\] in my grandparents’ house. Edmond Hoyle was considered quite the expert on cards and other games in the 18th century. He wrote many pamphlets or treatises on various games such as Whist, Quadrille, Piquet, Backgammon as well as books on probability theory and chess. In 1748, his pamphlets were collected and sold under the title of Mr. Hoyle’s Treatises of Whist, Quadrille, Piquet, Chess and Back-Gammon.  
- [Hazard](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Hazard) (precursor to craps): Choosing 7 gives you the best chance of winning if you are the caster. Winning is a “nick” or a “throw in.” Losing “throws out.” Rules are a bit confusing, but as in craps you can bet with or against the shooter/caster in all kinds of side-bets/special bets. The shooter chooses a number from 5 to 9 to serve as the Main (the function of the seven in craps). If the first roll (what is called the "come out roll" in craps) is the Main, then the shooter wins. If the first roll is a 2 or 3, then the shooter loses. If the Come Out Roll is an 11 or 12, then what happens depends on the Main, as follows: Main of 5 or 9: 11 and 12 both lose. Main of 6 or 8: 11 loses and 12 wins. Main of 7: 11 wins and 12 loses. The remaining numbers are known as the "chances." For example, if the Main is 5, then the chances are 4,6,7,8,9, and 10\. If the shooter rolls one of those numbers, it becomes known as the "chance" (point). The shooter will then keep throwing the dice until he rolls either the Main or the Chance. If the first to appear is the Chance, then the shooter wins. Otherwise, if the Main is first to appear, then the shooter loses.  
- [Whist](https://www.kristenkoster.com/a-regency-primer-on-how-to-play-whist/) (similar to Hearts or Spades): Standard 52-card deck ranked in order from highest to lowest: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, down to the deuce (or two). Four players form two pairs and the partners sit opposite each other at the table. Pairs may be chosen by drawing cards: two highest against the two lowest. Players may not comment on the cards they are dealt in any way or signal their partners. Lead suit, trumps, etc. so that if a Player does not have a card in the lead suit, he can win with the trump suit or discard any other card in another suit. Once all 13 tricks have been played, the pair collecting the most tricks scores 1 point for each trick taken in excess of six (called ‘making book’). A game is over when a team reaches 5 points. Variations include playing to 7 or 9 points. Playing a “rubber of whist” meant that the winners were determined by the best of three games.  
- The caption of a period etching of gamblers dressed as witches at a table: ‘[ruin enters as fate runs out.](https://londonhistorians.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/gambling-in-londons-most-ruinous-gentlemens-clubs/)’  
- Chuck-a-luck, also called sweat-cloth: a dice game of mediaeval origin that is related to grand hazard. It is played with three dice and a layout numbered from one to six upon which the players place their bets. The banker then rolls the dice by turning over an hourglass-shaped wire cage in which they are contained. The payoffs are usually 1 to 1 on singles, 2 to 1 on pairs, and 3 to 1 on triples appearing on the dice; for example, if a player places a bet on six and two sixes appear on the dice, the player is paid off at 2 to 1\. The game can be found in some American and European casinos and gambling houses. The house edge, or mathematical advantage, averages 7.5 percent.  
- Piquet: a game for two people who use a deck of 36 cards – the aces through sixes. Each hand of piquet is played in five parts; blanks and discards, ruffs, sequences, sets, and tricks. The players play until one scores 100\.  
- Faro: a game where players bet on cards that were turned up from a spring-loaded device called a faro box. The players gathered around a table with a deck of cards printed on it. The players put their bets on the card they thought would pop up. The dealer (who was also the banker) popped a card from the faro box – for example, an eight. That was the losing card, and if you had bet on the eight, you lost your money. The dealer popped up another card – for example, a four. That was the winning card and if you bet on it, you won. Those two cards were known as a turn. After one turn, you could increase, decrease or change your bets. There were other rules too, such as *coppering a bet* where the player bet a card would not turn up. The opportunities for cheating were almost all *on the dealer’s side – it was easy to “fix” the faro box.* Faro has since mostly died out.  
- Baccarat: Dealers can’t take anything from your hand, so you set it onto the table first. Bet on either the player or the banker, the object is to get as close to nine (or exactly nine) as possible, without going over. Getting an eight or a nine is called a **natural**, and no more cards will be dealt. Bets paid back 1:1. **You can make a bet on the Tie, which pays 8:1. You can bet on a pair for either the Player or the Banker, and that pays 11:1.** When you go over a count of nine, you drop the first digit. So a 10 becomes 0 (AKA Baccarat), and a 12 becomes 2\. 20 also becomes 0\. **All winning bank bets pay a 5% commission**, since the Banker bets have a slightly higher chance of winning, being the last hand to be acted on, so that whether the Player gets a third card is determined first, and then the Banker, giving a slight edge to the Banker hand, because t**he third card could make the Player’s hand worse.**   
- Vingt et un \- “Twenty-One”  
- In Great Britain and Ireland, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries, assembly rooms were gathering places for members of the higher social classes open to members of both sexes. ... Also to some extent they were supplanted by the ballrooms of major hotels as British hotels became larger from the railway age onwards.  
- *In Victorian Parlours, and thusly in our ‘World,’ women are only allowed to accompany their gents.*

##### *Notable Nobles (Scandal\!)*

- Beau Brummel had to flee to France when his gambling debts got too high. \[...\] **Lord Byron’s daughter, Ada, Countess of Lovelace was a talented mathematician who tried to use her mathematical ability to devise a system that would allow her to beat the odds at horse racing. As good a mathematician as she was, she never did beat the odds and piled up large debts**. \[This might be why she was in trouble on "Derby Day" in D.E.\]  
- John Montague, the 4th Earl of Sandwich is said to have asked a servant to bring him sliced meat between two pieces of bread so he could continue gambling and not have to get up and eat.

##### *Billiards Origins*

- Black pool was a gambling game which involved as many coloured balls as there were players along with a black ball. Each player owned a coloured ball which serves as his cue ball but is an object ball to the others. **If it is potted he must pay the striker** who is then allowed to pot the black ball. If he succeeds on the black ball, then all his opponents must pay him.   
- A good player will alternate potting a coloured ball and the black ball to maximize winnings. Balls are respotted after being sunk. In pyramid pool there were 15 red balls and a white cue ball, and each player received one point per red ball potted.

#### *Explosives*

- When he was 17, \[Alfred\] Nobel apprenticed in New York with the Swedish-American inventor John Ericsson, who later built the Monitor, the Union’s ironclad warship that became famous for defeating the Confederacy’s Merrimac. When Nobel returned to St. Petersburg, the family factory was booming thanks to the Crimean War. When the war ended and the firm went into bankruptcy, Nobel and his father turned to developing methods to produce nitroglycerin in quantity for use in construction. In 1862 Nobel began its manufacture in a small plant outside Stockholm—a venture that cost the life of his youngest brother, Emil. Nobel persevered with his goal of developing a safe nitroglycerin explosive, first inventing the blasting cap and then discovering that a silicaceous earth, kieselguhr, would stabilise nitroglycerin, thus making dynamite.  
- A Blasting cap, also called Detonator, is a device that initiates the detonation of a charge of a high explosive by subjecting it to percussion by a shock wave. In strict usage, the term detonator refers to an easily ignited low explosive that produces the shock wave, and the term primer, or priming composition, denotes a substance that produces a sudden burst of flame to ignite the detonator. The primer may be set off by the brief application of heat (from a burning fuse or an electrically heated wire), by friction, or by mechanical shock (like the impact of the firing pin of a gun). Depending on the preferred method of initiating the explosion, the blasting cap may contain a primer alone or both a primer and a detonator.  
- In 1865, Alfred Nobel invented the blasting cap, which consisted of a small metal cap containing mercury fulminate. Mercury fulminate was the only substance known at the time which could be used with reasonable safety for manufacturing  
- Nitroglycerin was first invented by Italian chemist Ascanio Sobrero (1812–1888) in 1846\. \[...\] Nobel understood this and in 1866 discovered that mixing nitroglycerin with silica would turn the liquid into a malleable paste called dynamite.

#### *Gin — The Scourge of the Underclass*

- "You had a poorer populace who aspired to drink like the king," says Lesley Solmonson, author of Gin: A Global History. "They wanted novelty. But the poor couldn't afford the genever that the king was drinking." Instead home distilling operations mushroomed, with some areas having every single building churning out bad gin. "They were using sulphuric acid, turpentine and lime oil," says Solmonson. "It was like death in a glass. One tankard could kill you." "People were drinking to forget their misery. These gins were roughly double what the proof of a modern gin is. And they were drinking a whole tankard of it." \- BBC

#### *Laudanum — An Epidemic by 1850*

- By the mid-19th century the practice seemed to have reached [epidemic proportions](https://wellcomecollection.org/articles/WckzzigAACe3DJPD), especially among mercenary 'nurses’ accused of caring for numerous babies by drugging them with laudanum-based products. One Manchester druggist admitted selling a half gallon of the market leader, Godfrey’s Cordial, and up to six gallons of a generic equivalent, euphemistically called ‘quietness’, each week.  
- Victorians took not just alcohol and opium but cannabis, coca, mescal and, with the invention of the hypodermic needle in the 1840s, morphine and heroin

#### *Wallets (19th Century)*

- In addition to money or currency, a wallet would also be used for carrying dried meat, victuals, "treasures", and "things not to be exposed". Wallets originally were used by early Industrial Americans. It was considered "semi-civilized" in 19th century America to carry one's wallet on one's belt. At this time, carrying goods or a wallet in one's pocket was considered uncivilised and uncommon.  
- In Spain, a wallet was a case for smoking paraphernalia: "Every man would carry a small sheaf of white paper in addition to a small leather wallet which would contain a flint and steel along with a small quantity of so-called yesca, being a dried vegetable fibre which a spark would instantly ignite."  
- Flat case \- a wallet, typically carried by a man  
- By the mid-1800s, the [flat case wallet](https://www.all-ett.com/blogs/blog/history-of-wallets) was more commonly used by middle-class men who competed with each other by displaying their wallets stuffed full of cash. These thick wallets were kept on belts as back in the 1800’s pockets were seen as a feminine accessory.

#### *Phonographs*

- The phonautograph is the earliest known device for recording sound, Invented by Frenchman Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, it was patented on March 25, 1857\. Then came Edison with the phonograph  
- "I was experimenting," Edison said, "on an automatic method of recording telegraph messages on a disk of paper laid on a revolving platen, exactly the same as the disk talking-machine of to-day. The platen had a spiral groove on its surface, like the disk. Over this was placed a circular disk of paper; an electromagnet with the embossing point connected to an arm travelled over the disk; and any signals given through the magnets were embossed on the disk of paper. If this disc was removed from the machine and put on a similar machine provided with a contact point, the [embossed record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph#Predecessors_to_the_phonograph) would cause the signals to be repeated into another wire.”  
- From 1888 Edison produced a series of improved phonographs using wax cylinders. Wax cylinder recording machines were used for the professional and amateur recording of Irish traditional music, both in Ireland and the diaspora. The production of home phonograph machines from 1892 onwards allowed musicians to record their own music. The Edison Standard model pictured \[**above**\] was first made in 1897\. It was an affordable machine, initially costing $20

#### *Currency*

- “The ridges on the edges of coins are thanks to Isaac Newton, who spent 30 years as warden of the Royal Mint. He recalled all plain edged coins in circulation and re-issued them with milled edges to stop people shaving bits off to make new ones”  
- Sovereign (gold Sovereign) \- a popular circulating coin (minted in 1817\) that was used in international trade and overseas, being trusted as a coin containing a known quantity of gold.  
- In dialog, characters could use words like farthings, ha’pennies, pennies, shillings, pounds, and sovereigns (this list is in roughly ascending order of value). For example, “In 1817, the sovereign was introduced, valued at 20 shillings.” But I imagined on the UI, there just being the £ symbol and a numerical value to keep it simple, and as you collected and spent the various denominations, the number would fluctuate from 2.76 to 121.25 and such  
- [Chart](https://victorianweb.org/economics/wages4.html) for cost of various necessities. Another [breakdown](https://logicmgmt.com/1876/living/money.htm) of prices  
- 20 Shillings in a Pound, 12 Pence in a Shilling, 12 Pence \= 1 Shilling, 20 Shillings \= 1 Pound, 2 ha’penny \= 1 pence, 4 Farthings (withdrawn in 1961\) in a pence, Fourpence \= 4 pence  
- Coin \- a general term for money \- feels a little obvious to define it in our Glossary; native English speakers will almost definitely understand (especially the kind who play this genre of game) and non-native speakers should probably be able to guess from context because "coin" and "money" already have such similar meanings.

#### *Bethnal Green (Slum-Sector in the East End)* 

- Economic focus shifted from mainstream farming produce for the City of London – through highly perishable goods production (market gardening), weaving, dock and building work and light industry – to a high proportion of commuters to city businesses…  
- The Kray twins lived in Bethnal Green in the 1960s.  
- The term *Bethnal Green* originally referred to a small common in the [Manor and Ancient Parish of Stepney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepney#Manor_and_Ancient_Parish); around which a small settlement developed. By the seventeenth century the area had become a *Hamlet*, a territorial subdivision of Stepney, with a degree of independence. Continued housebuilding and population growth in the 18th century led to the Hamlet area becoming a fully independent daughter parish in 1743\. The parish had a church, a benefice (for its priest) [and vestry (for its people)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Bethnal_Green) in 1743\. In 1855 Bethnal Green was included within the area of the [Metropolitan Board of Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Board_of_Works) to which it nominated one member and the various local government bodies were replaced by a single incorporated vestry which consisted of 48 elected vestrymen. A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales, which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church, and consequently became known colloquially as the "vestry".

#### *Grub Street*

- Until the early 19th century, Grub Street was a street close to London's impoverished Moorfields district. \[It was\] pierced along its length with narrow entrances to alleys and courts, many of which retained the names of early signboards. Its bohemian society was set amidst the impoverished neighbourhood's low-rent dosshouses, brothels and coffeehouses.  
- Famous for its concentration of impoverished "hack writers", aspiring poets, and low-end publishers and booksellers, Grub Street existed on the margins of London's journalistic and literary scene.  
- The street was later renamed Milton Street, which was partly swallowed up by the Barbican Estate development, but still survives in part.

#### *Victorian [Workhouses](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Victorian-Workhouse/)* 

1. Victorian workhouses, designed to deal with the issue of pauperism, \[became\] prison systems detaining the most vulnerable in society.  
   1. Some parishes legally forbid second helpings of food.  
   2. Origins of the workhouse can be traced back to the Poor Law Act of 1388\. In the aftermath of the Black Death, labour shortages were a major problem. The movement of workers to other parishes in search of higher paid work was restricted. By enacting laws to deal with vagrancy and prevent social disorder, the laws increased the involvement of the state in its responsibility to the poor. Laws were becoming more distinct and made clear delineations between those who were genuinely unemployed and others who had no intention of working.  
   3. By 1536, the church had become a major source of relief. By 1576 the law stipulated in the Poor Relief Act that if a person was able and willing, they needed to work in order to receive support. Furthermore in 1601, a further legal framework would make the parish responsible for enacting the poor relief within its geographic boundaries.  
   4. the state would provide relief and the legal responsibility fell on the parish.  
   5. People who were able to work were thus given the offer of employment in a house of correction, essentially to serve as a punishment for people who were capable of working but were unwilling. This was a system designed to deal with the **“persistent idlers”.**  
   6. By 1723, anyone looking to receive poor relief \[could\] enter the workhouse and proceed to work for a set amount of time, regularly, for no pay, in a system called indoor relief.  
   7. When enacting the Poor Laws in some cases, some parishes forced horrendous family situations, for example whereby a husband would sell his wife in order to avoid them becoming a burden which would prove costly to the local authorities.  
   8. A factory-style production line which used children was both unsafe and in the age of industrialisation, focused on profit rather than solving issues of pauperism.  
   9. In 1834, the authorities introduced the Poor Law Amendment Act, more commonly referred to as the New Poor Law. The consensus at the time was that the system of relief was being abused and that a new approach had to be adopted. The New Poor Law brought about the formation of Poor Law Unions which brought together individual parishes, as well as attempting to discourage the provision of relief for anyone not entering the workhouse. This new system hoped to deal with the financial crisis with some authorities hoping to use the workhouses as profitable endeavours.  
   10. Workers crushed bone to make fertiliser and picked oakum using a large nail called a spike. Once an individual had entered the workhouse they would be given a uniform to be worn for the entirety of their stay. The inmates were prohibited from talking to one another…   
   11. Families were split, forced to sell what little belongings they had and hoping they could see themselves through this rigorous system. Under the Unions, workhouses were run by “Guardians” (merciless administrators who sought profit).  
   12. It evolved from the most able-bodied carrying out labour, to a refuge for the elderly and sick. By 1929, new legislation was introduced which allowed local authorities to take over workhouses as hospitals. The following year, officially workhouses were closed, although the volume of people caught up in the system and with no other place to go meant that it would be several years later before the system was totally dismantled. In 1948 with the introduction of the National Assistance Act the last remnants of the Poor Laws were eradicated and with them, the workhouse institution.

**St Pancras Workhouse, London, 1911**

#### *Victorian Street Crawlers*

- Beggars who beg from other beggars, moving from Common Lodging Houses. Theft between their ranks, disease, despair, suffering. They show up for work at Workhouses, and exhaust themselves so severely just to eat that they collapse.  
- “What I cannot endure is the awful, lazy, idle life I am forced to lead. It is 1000x worse than the hardest labor and I would much rather my hands were blistered with toil than as you see them red and smarting from the exposure to the sun, the rain, and the cold.” — Scottie (Scottish woman)

#### *Contraception & Childbirth*

- Victorian women might be almost continually pregnant, between marriage and menopause. Some contraceptive advice was available, and condoms could be bought, but only ‘under the counter’. Coitus interruptus remained the principal method of family limitation. Childbirth was risky and painful. There was a wide belief that labour pains were imposed by God because Eve had sinned in the Garden of Eden. It took Dr Snow – the same man who discovered the source of cholera – to alleviate labour pains by administering chloroform. When Queen Victoria and the daughter of the Archbishop of Canterbury used it, anaesthesia had become respectable.


#### *Prostitution*

- Reformers started mobilizing in the late 1840s, major news organisations, clergymen, and single women became increasingly concerned about [prostitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_morality), which came to be known as "The Great Social Evil". Estimates of the number of prostitutes in London in the 1850s vary widely (in his landmark study, Prostitution, William Acton reported that the police estimated there were 8,600 in London alone in 1857).  
- While the Magdalene asylums had been reforming prostitutes since the mid-18th century, the years between 1848 and 1870 saw a veritable explosion in the number of institutions working to "reclaim" these "fallen women" from the streets and retrain them for entry into respectable society—usually for work as domestic servants. The theme of prostitution and the "fallen woman" (any woman who has had sexual intercourse out of marriage) became a staple feature of mid-Victorian literature and politics. In the writings of Henry Mayhew, Charles Booth, Charles Dickens and others, prostitution began to be seen as a social problem.  
- When Parliament passed the first of the Contagious Diseases Acts (CD) in 1864 (which allowed the local constabulary in certain defined areas to force any woman suspected of venereal disease to submit to its inspection), Josephine Butler's crusade to repeal the CD Acts yoked the anti-prostitution cause with the emergent feminist movement. Butler attacked the long-established double standard of sexual morality.  
- Prostitutes were often presented as victims in sentimental literature such as Thomas Hood's poem The Bridge of Sighs, Elizabeth Gaskell's novel Mary Barton, and Dickens' novel Oliver Twist. The emphasis on the purity of women found in such works as Coventry Patmore's The Angel in the House led to the portrayal of the prostitute and fallen woman as soiled, corrupted, and in need of cleansing.

#### *Emerging Femenism*

- Coverture (sometimes spelled couverture) \- a legal doctrine in common law whereby, upon marriage, a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband, in accordance with the wife's legal status of feme covert. An unmarried woman, or feme sole, had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name. Coverture arises from the legal fiction that a husband and wife are one person.  
- [Josephine Elizabeth Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Butler) (née Grey; 13 April 1828 – 30 December 1906\) was an English feminist and social reformer in the Victorian era. She campaigned for women's suffrage, the right of women to better education, the end of coverture in British law, the abolition of child prostitution, and an end to human trafficking of young women and children into European prostitution.

#### *Humorism & Phrenology*

- Humorism, the humoral theory, or humoralism, was a system of medicine detailing a supposed makeup and workings of the human body originated in Persia (Iran) and adopted by Ancient Greek and Roman physicians and philosophers after contact with the Persians.   
- Four temperament theory \- a proto-psychological theory which suggests that there are four fundamental personality types: sanguine, choleric, melancholic, and phlegmatic. Most formulations include the possibility of mixtures among the types where an individual's personality types overlap and they share two or more temperaments. Greek physician Hippocrates described the four temperaments as part of the ancient medical concept of Humorism, that four bodily fluids affect human personality traits and behaviours.  
- Humorism began to fall out of favor in the 1850s with the advent of germ theory, which was able to show that many diseases previously thought to be humoral were in fact caused by pathogens.  
- Temperament traits (such as Neuroticism, Sociability, Impulsivity, etc.) \- distinct patterns in behavior throughout a lifetime, but they are most noticeable and most studied in children. Babies are typically described by temperament, but longitudinal research in the 1920s began to establish temperament as something which is stable across the lifespan.  
- [Two-factor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_models_of_personality#Table_of_theories_and_instruments_using_extroversion_and_people-task-orientation) \- a measurement of personality, behavior and temperament. It most often consists of a matrix measuring the factor of introversion and extroversion with some form of people versus task orientation. Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936), from his work with dogs, came up with the factors of "passivity" (active or passive) and "extremeness" (extreme response or moderate response). His view of the temperaments in dogs was: The Melancholic type (Weak inhibitory): categorized as "weak" dogs; Choleric type (Strong excitatory): strong, unbalanced, easily aroused (excitable); Sanguine type (Lively): strong, balanced, mobile; Phlegmatic type (Calm imperturbable): strong, balanced, sluggish. This theory would also be extended to humans.  
- Alfred Adler (1879–1937) measured "activity" (connected with "energy") against "social interest", yielding the four "styles of life": Ruling or Dominant type: high activity, low social interest; Getting or Leaning type: low activity, high social interest; Avoiding type: low activity, low social interest; Socially Useful type: high activity, high social interest  
- Phrenology \- the study of the conformation of the skull as indicative of mental faculties and traits of character, especially according to the hypotheses of Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828), a German doctor, and such 19th-century adherents as Johann Kaspar Spurzheim (1776–1832) and George Combe (1788–1858). Phrenology enjoyed great popular appeal well into the 20th century but has been wholly discredited by scientific research.  
- Science and self-assessment: [phrenological charts](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Science-and-self-assessment%3A-phrenological-charts-Sysling/4573ef6336b8f050385460e8353b53156660ef14): 1840–1940  
- Bumposopher \- expert in the pseudoscientific study of bumps on the skull; a phrenologist. Origin Mid 19th century; earliest use found in Blackwood's Magazine. From bump \+ \-osopher.  
- Psychograph \- an instrument designed to produce phrenology measurements  
- [Process](http://www.historyofphrenology.org.uk/donovan_heads.html) also included feeling the head with the hands: “These Organs being steadily and repeatedly manipulated and their sizes noted, the sides of the head come next. Here the two hands come into operation : feeling the pair of Organs, not with the tips but with the inside of the fingers, and this gently and softly, " as if you loved them." " Combativeness " is immediately behind the ear, above the mastoid bone-it is felt with both hands. It requires a good deal of practice to estimate this Organ correctly ; usually it is in the middle state. " Destructiveness " is inside the helix of the ear- two-handed also. Time will be required to judge it correctly. " Secretiveness " lies above " Combativeness " and " Destructiveness ;" and when the hands are laid softly along the sides of the head-the tip of the little finger to the tip of the ear-a full development of the Organ throws the fingers outwards. (See Plates.) " Acquisitiveness " lies in front of " Secretiveness," and is rather easily estimated, as is " Constructiveness " directly in front. Still, it will take much practice before anything like adroitness can be gained.  
- [Four Temperaments](http://www.historyofphrenology.org.uk/temperament.htm): lymphatic, sanguine, fibrous/bilious, and nervous **(Atticus is ‘Fibrous’)** \- "There are four temperaments, accompanied by different degrees of strength and activity in the brain-the lymphatic, the sanguine, the bilious, and the nervous. The temperaments are supposed to depend upon the constitution of particular systems of the body: the brain and nerves being predominantly active from constitutional causes, seem to produce the nervous temperament; the lungs, heart, and blood vessels being constitutionally predominant, to give rise to the sanguine ; the muscular and fibrous systems to the bilious; and the glands and assimilating organs to the lymphatic. The different temperaments are indicated by external signs, which are open to observation. The first, or **lymphatic**, is distinguishable by a round form of the body, softness of the muscular system, repletion of the cellular tissue, fair hair, and a pale skin. It is accompanied by languid vital actions, with weakness and slowness in the circulation. The brain, as part of the system, is also slow, languid, and feeble in its action, and the mental manifestations are proportionally weak. The second or **sanguine** temperament is indicated by well defined forms, moderate plumpness of person, tolerable firmness of flesh, light hair inclining to chestnut, blue eyes, and fair complexion, with ruddiness of countenance. It is marked by great activity of the blood vessels, fondness for exercise, and an animated countenance. The brain partakes of the general state, and is vigorous and active. The **fibrous** (generally, but inappropriately, termed the **bilious**) temperament is recognised by black hair, dark skin, moderate fullness and much firmness of flesh, with harshly expressed outline of the person. The functions partake of great energy of action, which extends to the brain; and the countenance, in consequence, shows strong, marked, and decided features. The **nervous** temperament is recognised by fine thin hair, thin skin, small thin muscles, quickness in muscular motion, paleness of countenance, and often delicate health. The whole nervous system, including the brain, is predominantly active and energetic, and the mental manifestations are proportionally vivacious and powerful."  
- Gall suggested that the brain was divided into 27 separate "organs". Each organ supposedly corresponded to a discrete human faculty, though Gall identified 19 of these faculties as being shared with other animal species. The first nineteen in the list below are organs allegedly common to men and animals; **the final eight are specific to humans.**  
  1\.    The instinct of reproduction (impulse to propagation)

  18\.  The sense of connectedness between numbers (arithmetic, time)  
  19\.  The sense of mechanics, of construction; the talent for architecture.  
  20\.  Comparative perspicuity, sagacity  
  21\.  The sense of metaphysics  
  22\.  The sense of satire; the sense of witticism, sense of inference  
  23\.  The poetical talent

- “The supporters of [phrenology](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259108026_Phrenology_and_Physiognomy_in_Victorian_Literature) correctly argued that the key elements of character and personality were located in the brain”  
- “Ludwig Heinrich Bojanus \[...\] provided two early accounts of what Gall was covering in his Vienna lectures: ‘Direct from In the ape, the hare, and the cock, this organ is very apparent; and in pigeons and sparrows the occipital forms a particular bag which seems to be an appendage of the head; and it is well known that these animals are exceedingly ardent in copulation. The same disposition is sometimes found in the cranium of man; and Dr. Gall has in his collection the skulls of several fools, who were distinguished by their lasciviousness, and whose occipital bone forms an enormous projection.’”  
  “Christian Heinrich Ernst Bischoff relates from a Gall lecture: ‘Among other cases of insanity, G. related one of a man, from whom the fixed idea could not be removed that he had six wives, \&c. The cerebellum was found monstrously large after his death. Once, on entering an hospital, in which he never was before, he heard a mad woman uttering the grossest obscenities, he desired the attendants to go and examine her head, declaring that if they did not find the skull remarkably large behind, he would renounce all his opinions. He was not deceived.’”  
  “‘A young widow, a short time after the death of her husband, was attacked by melancholy and violent convulsions. These affections were preceded by a very disagreeable tension and feeling of heat in the nape of her neck. A few moments afterwards, she fell to the ground in a state of rigidity, to such an extent that at last the nape of her neck and vertebral column were strongly drawn backwards. The crisis never failed to terminate by an evacuation, which was accompanied by a convulsive voluptuousness, and a real ecstasy; after which she continued free from attacks for some time. I frequently supported her during the crisis with the palm of my hand on the nape of her neck, and felt at that spot a great heat. I remarked also an arched protuberance of considerable size in the same place. Afterwards this lady acknowledged to me, that from the close of childhood, she had felt it impossible to resist the impulses of an imperious necessity; and that in these moments, when her feelings were the most urgent, the tension and sensation of heat in the nape of the neck were the most disagreeable.’  
  “He argued \[that\] he could establish the size of the cerebellum by measuring the distance between the mastoid processes. If the cerebellum is large, he opined, “the nape of the neck is large and thick, the neck rounded, and large and thick behind the ears.” \- [fronteirsin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00040/full)  
- “Many modern phrases trace their roots to phrenology, including “highbrow” and “lowbrow,” “well rounded,” \[...\] “French scientist **Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens** became one of Gall’s most powerful adversaries. Flourens systematically tested Gall’s theories on animals, removing portions of the brains of dogs, rabbits, and birds to examine how the remaining sections functioned. His experiments led him to conclude that Gall was wrong: that the brain acted as a whole unit and not as discrete parts. Damage to one area caused other parts to take over and perform the same function. He published his findings in two explosive exposes.” \- [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-shape-of-your-head-and-the-shape-of-your-mind/282578/)

#### *Mental Illness*

- Treatment for mental illness or nervous disorders had changed little since mediaeval times. Those sufferers lower down the social scale were locked up in County Asylums. Private ‘madhouses’ were often profitable institutions. Women might be locked away there by their husbands if he disapproved of her behaviour. Such dramatic stories were the subjects of popular fiction such as The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins.  
- Trephine \- an instrument used for cutting out a round piece of skull bone to relieve pressure beneath a surface. (trepanning chisel)

#### *Mental Hospitals*

- Families could literally just ‘purchase confinement’ for relatives.  
- “Edith Lanchester was a young feminist who decided to live with her lover without getting married. Her family found this intolerable, and, in 1895, her father and two brothers captured her and had her locked an asylum in Roehampton. This was endorsed by a Dr Burrows, who declared that Miss Lanchester’s decision equated to a threat of committing ‘social suicide’ and was therefore evidence of irrationality. He diagnosed her as was suffering from a specific ‘monomania’ related to her attitudes to marriage. Lucky for her, the Lunacy Commissioners came to inspect the asylum two days later and freed her.” from article on [Victorian Crimes](https://crimereads.com/the-victorian-underworlds-most-unusual-crimes/)  
- Hair pulling and solitary confinement. Each door is locked separately. Windows are barred. Women confined ten to a room.   
- Syphilis was incurable until the invention of antibiotics, so they used Malarial Treatment: Intentionally injecting the germs into the bloodstream based on theory that malarial fever could kill syphilis. Half of patients saw a reduction in syphilis symptoms after the treatment, but \~15% of them died from Malaria taking hold.  
- Branding with hot iron, spinning wheel, swinging them to try and bring them to their senses. “You get out of there by faking it… doing what the docs tell you.”  
- Dumbwaiters used inside, on the outside the architecture was majestic, as beauty was supposed to help with treatment, but this was only the surface facade. There were even Asylum tourists. Even so, patients were treated like prisoners.  
- Nellie Bly was an undercover journalist (but I think in the US)  
- Diet as treatment — Tea, a piece of bread, rancid butter and five prunes.  
- Some patients hardly slept, and screamed constantly all night. Some begged for death rather than stay in treatment.

- [Bethnal Green Asylum](https://www.layersoflondon.org/map/records/bethnal-green-asylum): Potential ‘based-on’ location for our Sanitarium. “The Warburton family owned a number of Bethnal Green asylums. These mainly housed pauper lunatics placed by their parish, although one was for private fee-paying clients. Bethnal House, which had operated as an asylum since 1727, was bought by Warburton in 1800 and became Bethnal Green Asylum providing for those funded by the parish. The male wing of Bethnal House is now Bethnal Green library and part of the old site is now occupied by Bethnal Green Estate. These sit to the rear of Cambridge Heath Road behind Bethnal Green Gardens, still sometimes known as Barmy Park.   
  Thomas Warburton was a member of the Hackney parish vestry (an early form of local government), a trustee of the poor and a committee member overseeing Dr Spurstowe’s almshouses. But the asylums he ran for paupers were anything but charitable. **Inmates were chained to bedsteads at night and slept naked, sometimes three to a bed, on straw that was left filthy.** Around 500 people were held in these conditions. **Parliamentary reports in 1816 and 1827 found beatings were common and medical treatment perfunctory.** These reports led to an 1828 Act for the Regulation of Madhouses requiring improved medical supervision. John Warburton, who took over when his father died, was already a doctor at St Luke’s charitable asylum in Old Street and was ready to transform the Bethnal Green Asylum. By 1831 the asylum had 933 patients. The new national Commissioners in Lunacy reported 1847 that it was the best in London.”  
- The Asylum or Sanitarium is at "Sandthorne," a fictional location based on the real-life Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security psychiatric hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire, 7 miles from Camberley, Surrey, England, approximately 31 miles southwest of Central London. \[Alternate is the Mile End Asylum, which is one mile from Whitechapel, and based on the real-life Bethnal Green Asylum.\]  
- Sandthorne Asylum \- A high-security psychiatric hospital near Camberley

#### *Orphanages*

##### [*Orphanage Research*](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57325653) *(6-9-21)*

- “Some of you can’t do any worse than your parents did,” says one instructor [in a lesson](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/i-learned-how-to-hate-what-it-was-like-to-attend-kamloops-indian-residential-school) about the spirit of Christmas. \- From a 1962 CBC program called “The Eyes of Children” filmed at Kamloops.  
- “Yes, ma’am, no sir, thank you, please, are all said naturally, in an unforced manner,” \- The show’s producer George Robinson  
- What the crew missed were the graves. A staged opening shot which shows smiling children gathered around the school’s principal would have passed within sight of the overgrown areas where a recent radar survey uncovered evidence of as many as 215 children’s graves. Four children at the school are known to have died in 1962 alone.  
- They also missed the serial child sex offender on the payroll. The Eyes of Children was filmed during the school’s employment of Gerald Mathieu Moran, a boy’s supervisor who in the 1990s would face several dozen charges for sex crimes committed at Kamloops Indian Residential School. After pleading guilty, Moran was given only three years in jail.  
- The strap or the cuff to the head that accompanied any transgression as minor as speaking during dinner.  
- “Golly, I learned a lot here,” former Kamloops Indian Residential School student Hector MacDonald would tell a 2013 Truth and Reconciliation hearing. “I learned how to hate. I learned how to steal. I learned how to fight. I learned how to cheat.”  
- a school supervisor going into the girls’ dormitory at night with a flashlight to choose a girl to assault.  
- Cramped, unventilated rooms that shared damp air with the building’s cellar all seemed to be tailor-made to “spread infection,” according to one contemporary press account.  
- “near-starvation rations.” “During a 1918 visit, Indian Agent J. Smith wrote that dinner portions “looked from where I sat to be very slim for growing boys.” Smith attempted to ask the boys if they had enough to eat, but in a place where they had been conditioned by force to not dissatisfy a white man under any circumstances, the students answered the Indian Agent “in the affirmative.””

##### *Aberlour Orphanage*

- Founded 1875 first with a cottage — “Burnside Cottage beside the Lour Burn opens its doors to four “**mitherlessbairns**” and the Aberlour Orphanage is born.  
- Then in 1877 Miss Macpherson Grant died. “The sudden death of Miss Macpherson Grant slows the development of the orphanage and puts its future in doubt.  
- Then in 1882 — “Mr W Grant of Wester Elchies leaves a legacy of £8,000 enabling land to be purchased to construct a bigger orphanage, and for St. Margaret’s Church to be completed.”  
- “Over the next few years further residential blocks (1902), a laundry and an isolation hospital (1906) are added.”

##### [*Tokens*](https://museumcrush.org/the-tokens-of-mothers-who-gave-up-their-babies-at-the-foundling-museum/) *left behind*

- “...each one is infused with a sense of hope, because a mother wouldn’t leave a token unless she hoped that one day she could come back to claim her child.”  
- A ring engraved with this saying — ‘Qui me negliege me perd’: ‘Take care of me or you will lose me.’  
- In the 19th century the admission policy changed significantly, and the children had to be illegitimate. But in the 18th century children came in for all sorts of reasons and poverty was the biggest one. We know that a number of children were admitted by mothers whose husbands were either fighting overseas, or they had been widowed. So their children weren’t illegitimate, they weren’t unwanted and unloved. These mothers gave up their children purely because they could not feed them.

##### [*The Blackguard Children*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackguard_Children)

- Sometimes also referred to as the Blackguard Youth; known as gangs of mostly homeless orphans and runaways who, during the 17th and 18th centuries, dwelled in London's poorest neighbourhoods (such as Glass House Yard, Rosemary Lane, and Salt Petre Bank) and made a living by begging and pilfering. Daniel Defoe's Colonel Jack and Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist are the most prominent examples of novels dealing with such reality.

##### [*Orphans & Child Labor*](https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/child-labour)

- …the average age at which children started work in early 19th-century Britain was 10 years old, but this varied widely between regions. In industrial areas, children started work on average at eight and a half years old. Most of these young workers entered the factories as piecers, standing at the spinning machines repairing breaks in the thread  
- The Factory Act of 1878 prohibited work before the age of 10 and applied to all trades.

##### [*Baby Farming*](https://crimereads.com/the-victorian-underworlds-most-unusual-crimes/)

- In the days when it was considered a disgrace to have a child out of wedlock, young unmarried mothers, or widowed fathers, would often pay an older woman to raise the child. In many cases, the mother or father would have no more contact, and it was this that allowed some terrible crimes to be committed by evil ‘baby farmers’. In the 1860s, the ‘Brixton baby-farmers’ Margaret Waters and Sarah Ellis killed at least 19 infants in their care through starvation. To make the hungry babies more manageable, they were given laudanum, a freely-available opium tincture. Perhaps the most notorious baby-farmer was Ameila Dyer, executed in 1896\. She killed her charges either through starvation or strangulation with fabric tape, the bodies being dumped in a canal. We don’t know exactly how many babies she killed, but historians estimate that over the twenty years of her career it could have been as many as fifty. When asked how to identify her victims, she said ‘You’ll know mine by the tape around their necks’.

The Crimean War \- a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856 in which Russia lost to an alliance of France, the Ottoman Empire, the United Kingdom and Piedmont-Sardinia.   
Relevant Italo-Governmental History \- On 17 March 1861, law no. 4671 of the Sardinian Parliament proclaimed the Kingdom of Italy, thus ratifying the annexations of all other Apennine states, plus Sicily, to the Kingdom of Sardinia. Until 1946, Italy remained a kingdom ruled by the House of Savoy, reigning royal house of Italy since the national unification in 1860 and previously rulers of the Duchy of Savoy. However, in 1922 the rise of Benito Mussolini and the creation of the fascist regime, which eventually resulted in engaging Italy in World War II alongside Nazi Germany, considerably weakened the role of the monarchy. Following the civil war and the Liberation from foreign troops in 1945, a popular referendum on the institutional form of the state was called and resulted in voters choosing the replacement of the monarchy with a republic by a close majority (54.3%).  
**Crimean War** \- Fought from 1853-56, in which Russia lost to a French, Ottoman, British, and Sardinian alliance  
The Charge of the Light Brigade \- a failed military action involving the British light cavalry led by Lord Cardigan against Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854 in the Crimean War. Lord Raglan had intended to send the Light Brigade to prevent the Russians from removing captured guns from overrun Turkish positions, a task for which the light cavalry were well-suited. However, there was miscommunication in the chain of command and the Light Brigade was instead sent on a frontal assault against a different artillery battery, one well-prepared with excellent fields of defensive fire. The Light Brigade reached the battery under withering direct fire and scattered some of the gunners, but they were forced to retreat immediately, and the assault ended with very high British casualties and no decisive gains. The events were the subject of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's narrative poem "The Charge of the Light Brigade" (1854), published just six weeks after the event. Its lines emphasise the valour of the cavalry in bravely carrying out their orders, regardless of the nearly inevitable outcome. Responsibility for the miscommunication has remained controversial, as the order was vague and Captain Louis Nolan delivered the written orders with some verbal interpretation, then died in the first minute of the assault.

      Laudanum \-  A tincture of 1% morphine by weight, prepared by extracts of the opium poppy, dissolved in high-proof alcohol. By the 1800s laudanum was widely available—it could be easily purchased from pubs, grocers, barber shops, tobacconists, pharmacies, and even confectioners. The drug was often cheaper than alcohol, making it affordable to all levels of society. It was prescribed for everything from soothing a cranky infant to treating headaches, persistent cough, gout, rheumatism, diarrhea, melancholy, and “women’s troubles.” Laudanum became widely used throughout Victorian society as a medicine, and soon many writers, poets, and artists (along with many ordinary people) became addicted. Bram Stoker, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, and others are known to have used it.

      Skeleton-blade \- A lock-picking device  
      Serinette \- type of mechanical musical instrument consisting of a small **barrel organ**. It appeared in the first half of the 18th century in eastern France, and was used to teach tunes to canaries. Its name is derived from the French serin, meaning “canary.” Serinettes are housed in a small wooden case, normally of walnut. The instrument is played by turning a crank mounted on the front. The crank pumps a bellows to supply air to the pipes, and also turns a wooden barrel by means of gears. Driven into the barrel are brass pins and staples with which the pieces of music are encoded.  
      Barrel organ (AKA roller organ or crank organ) \- a mechanical musical instrument consisting of bellows and one or more ranks of pipes housed in a case, usually of wood, and often highly decorated. The basic principle is the same as a traditional pipe organ, but rather than being played by an organist, the barrel organ is activated either by a person turning a crank, or by clockwork driven by weights or springs. The pieces of music are encoded onto wooden barrels (or cylinders).  
      Zoetrope \- one of several pre-film animation devices that produce the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawings or photographs showing progressive phases of that motion. It was basically a cylindrical variation of the phénakisticope, suggested almost immediately after the stroboscopic discs were introduced in 1833\. The definitive version, with easily replaceable picture strips, was introduced as a toy by Milton Bradley in 1866 and became very successful  
      Phenakistiscope (also spelled phénakisticope or phenakistoscope) \- the first widespread animation device that created a fluent illusion of motion. Dubbed Fantascope or ‘Magic Disk’ and Stroboscopische Scheiben ('stroboscopic discs') by its inventors, it has been known under many other names until the French product name Phénakisticope became common (with alternative spellings). The GIF is Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X (Trentsensky & Vieweg 1833).  
      Leyden-jar \- electrical component storing a high-voltage electric charge from an external source, between electrical conductors on the inside and outside of a glass jar. Typically, a glass jar with metal foil cemented to the inside and the outside surfaces, and a metal terminal projecting vertically through the jar lid to make contact with te inner foil. The original form of the capacitor.  
      Capacitor \- device storing electrical energy in an electric field. It’s a passive electronic component with two terminals.  
      Induction coil or "spark coil" (archaically known as an inductorium or Ruhmkorff coil after Heinrich Rühmkorff) \- a type of electrical transformer used to produce high-voltage pulses from a low-voltage direct current (DC) supply. To create the flux changes necessary to induce voltage in the secondary coil, the direct current in the primary coil is repeatedly interrupted by a vibrating mechanical contact called an interrupter.  
      Lithia water \- a type of mineral water characterised by the presence of lithium salts (as lithium carbonate or lithium chloride). Natural lithia mineral spring waters are rare, and there are few commercially bottled lithia water products. Between the 1880s and World War I, the consumption of bottled lithia mineral water was popular.  
      **Bright’s disease** (justification for organ harvesting by elites) \- A historical classification of kidney diseases that would be described in modern medicine as acute or chronic nephritis. It was characterized by swelling and the presence of albumin in the urine, and was frequently accompanied by high blood pressure and heart disease. The symptoms and signs of Bright's disease were first described in **1827 by the English physician Richard Bright**, after whom the disease was named. In his Reports of Medical Cases, he described 25 cases of **dropsy (edema)** which he attributed to kidney disease. Symptoms and signs included: inflammation of serous membranes, hemorrhages, apoplexy, convulsions, blindness and coma. Many of these cases were found to have albumin in their urine (detected by the spoon and candle-heat coagulation), and showed striking morbid changes of the kidneys at autopsy.  
      Dropsy \- (archaic) the swelling of soft tissues due to the accumulation of excess water. In years gone by, a person might have been said to have dropsy. Today one would be more descriptive and specify the cause. Thus, the person might have edema due to congestive heart failure.  
      Also \- Gouty diathesis \- the formation of urinary stones in persons with primary gout.  
      Paraffin (wax or oil) \- colourless, flammable, oily liquid similarly obtained and used as fuel, especially kerosene. noun: paraffin oil; plural noun: paraffin oils.  
      Limelight (also known as Drummond light or calcium light) \- (from Wiki) a type of stage lighting once used in theatres and music halls. An intense illumination is created when an oxyhydrogen flame is directed at a cylinder of quicklime (calcium oxide), which can be heated to 2,572 °C (4,662 °F) before melting. The light is produced by a combination of incandescence and candoluminescence. Although it has long since been replaced by electric lighting, the term has nonetheless survived, as someone in the public eye is still said to be "in the limelight". The actual lights are called "limes"  
      Pastern \- the sloping part of a horse's foot between the fetlock and the hoof. Also a corresponding part in some other domestic animals. *For Atticus.*  
      Fetlock \- The joints of a cow or other ungulate's legs between the cannon bone and pastern, with equivalence to the ankle area; the joint of a horse's or other quadruped's leg between the cannon bone and the pastern.  
      ‘Puss-and-Mew machine’ \- The contraption was simple. The gin-seller found a window in an alleyway that was nowhere near the building’s front door. The window was covered and boarded over with a wooden cat. The gin-buyer would approach and say to the cat: “Puss, give me two pennyworth of gin,” and then place the coins in the cat’s mouth. These would slide inwards to the gin-seller who would pour the gin down a lead pipe that emerged under the cat’s paw. The crowds loved it and the inventor, Dudley Bradstreet, made three or four pounds a day, which was a lot of money. As nobody witnessed both sides of the transaction, no charges could be brought.  
      [Paris’s **pneumatic** **mail network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_pneumatic_post) \-  Commenced in 1866 by the construction of an experimental line between the telegraph offices at Grand Hotel and place de la Bourse. This was extended in 1867 into a one-way hexagon from place de la Bourse through the telegraph offices rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, rue de Rivoli, rue des Saints-Peres, the Central Telegraph Office (rue de Grenelle), rue Boissy d'Anglas, and back to Grand Hotel. In 1879, with the opening of the service to the public, there was a new motive for expansion and, in 1881 plans were approved to extend the network of tubes across the whole of Paris.  
      India rubber \- one name for the natural rubber that comes from the sap of certain trees. This material was first brought to the West by 18th century explorers of the Indies, who loaned the word India to the gummy substance, which was eventually dubbed rubber because of its ability to rub out pencil marks on paper.  
      [Electroplating](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/morbid-monday-electroplating-corpses) \- ‘coat\[ing\] a body with wax and cover\[ing\] it with a conducting solution before wrapping it with copper wire and then carrying out the electroplating process so your dearly departed is turned into a gilded ornament.’  
      Electroplating is the process of plating one metal onto another by hydrolysis, most commonly for decorative purposes or to prevent corrosion of a metal. There are also specific types of electroplating such as copper plating, silver plating, and chromium plating. Electroplating describes processes that create a metal coating on a solid substrate through the reduction of cations of that metal by means of a direct electric current. The part to be coated acts as the cathode (negative electrode) of an electrolytic cell; the electrolyte is a solution of a salt of the metal to be coated; and the anode (positive electrode) is usually either a block of that metal, or of some inert conductive material. The current is provided by an external power supply. Electroplating is widely used in industry and decorative arts to improve the surface qualities of objects—such as resistance to abrasion and corrosion, lubricity, reflectivity, electrical conductivity, or appearance. It may also be used to build up thickness on undersized or worn-out parts, or to manufacture metal plates with complex shape, a process called electroforming. It is also used to purify metals such as copper. The term "electroplating" may also be used occasionally for processes that use an electric current to achieve oxidation of anions onto a solid substrate, as in the formation of silver chloride on silver wire to make silver/silver-chloride electrodes. **Electropolishing**, a process that uses an electric current to remove metal cations from the surface of a metal object, may be thought of as the opposite of electroplating.  
      Lubricity- the measure of the reduction in friction and or wear by a lubricant. The study of lubrication and wear-mechanisms is called **tribology.**  
      Tin Willie \- (mine) (Informal) an automaton  
      Anthropometry \- measurement of the human body  
      **Criminal anthropometry to fingerprinting** \-   
      ![][image1]![][image2]  
        
      “[Anthropometry](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/anthropometry) was first introduced in the late nineteenth century to the field of criminalistics, helping to identify individual criminals by physical characteristics. [Francis Galton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton), a key contributor to the field, would later find flaws with Bertillon’s system. Galton realised that variables originally believed independent, such as forearm length and leg length, could be combined into a single causal variable defined as "stature." Galton, in realising the redundancy of Bertillon’s measurements, had developed the statistical concept of correlation. Alphonse Bertillon's goal was to use anthropometry as a way of identifying recidivists, or criminals likely to repeat their offence. Before the use of anthropometry, police officials relied solely on general descriptions and names to make arrests, and were unable to apprehend criminals employing false identities. Upon arrest, it was difficult to identify which criminals were first-time offenders and which were repeat offenders. Though the photographing of criminals had become common, it proved ineffectual, as a system had not been found to visually arrange the photographs in a fashion that allowed easy use. Bertillon believed that through the use of anthropometry, all information about an individual criminal could be reduced to a set of identifying numbers which could then be entered into a large filing system. Bertillon also envisioned his system as being organised in such a way that, if recorded measurements were limited, the system would still work to drastically reduce the number of potential matches through the categorising of characteristics as either small, medium, or large. If the length of an individual’s arm was categorised as medium, and the size of the foot known, the number of potential records to be compared would be drastically reduced. Bertillon believed that with more measurements of independent variables, a more precise identification system could be achieved and paired with photographic evidence.”   
      “In 1897, [Sir Edward Richard Henry](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/worlds-oldest-fingerprint-bureau-gets-own-home/articleshow/92193308.cms), the then inspector-general of police, transformed Kolkata \[capital of the Indian state of West Bengal\] Anthropometric Bureau into a full-fledged Fingerprinting Bureau \[...\] Two sub-inspectors — Hem Chandra Bose and Azizul Haque developed a system to sort fingerprints based on physiological characteristics, developing what came to be known as the Henry Classification System.” (**Bengal’s fingerprint system)**  
      “[Bertillon’s system](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/anthropometry) of measurements exhibited certain defects which led to it falling into disuse. Objections to the Bertillonage system also included the exorbitant costs of anthropometric instruments, the need for exceptionally well-trained employees, and the significant opportunity for error. Measures taken or recorded with inaccuracy could seldom, if ever, be corrected, and would defeat all chance of a successful search. Bertillonage was also deemed slow, as it was necessary to repeat the anthropometrical process three times to arrive at a mean result. In 1897, Bertillonage was replaced throughout British India by the adoption of **Bengal’s fingerprint system**. As the result of a fresh inquiry ordered by the Home Office, three years later, England followed suit and fingerprints alone came to be relied upon for identification.”

[The Russian Revolution of 1917](https://www.history.com/topics/russia/russian-revolution) \- “one of the most explosive political events of the twentieth century. The violent revolution marked the end of the Romanov dynasty and centuries of Russian Imperial rule. During the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks, led by leftist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, seized power and destroyed the tradition of czarist rule. The Bolsheviks would later become the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. \[...\] In 1917, two revolutions swept through Russia, ending centuries of imperial rule and setting into motion political and social changes that would lead to the eventual formation of the Soviet Union.  
However, while the two revolutionary events took place within a few short months of 1917, social unrest in Russia had been brewing for many years prior to the events of that year.  
In the early 1900s, Russia was one of the most impoverished countries in Europe with an enormous peasantry and a growing minority of poor industrial workers. Much of Western Europe viewed Russia as an undeveloped, backwards society. The Russian Empire practised serfdom—a form of feudalism in which landless peasants were forced to serve the land-owning nobility—well into the nineteenth century. In contrast, the practice had disappeared in most of Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. In 1861, the Russian Empire finally abolished serfdom. The emancipation of serfs would influence the events leading up to the Russian Revolution by giving peasants more freedom to organise.  
What Caused the Russian Revolution \- The Industrial Revolution gained a foothold in Russia much later than in Western Europe and the United States. When it finally did, around the turn of the 20th century, it brought with it immense social and political changes.  
Between 1890 and 1910, for example, the population of major Russian cities such as St. Petersburg and Moscow nearly doubled, resulting in overcrowding and destitute living conditions for a new class of Russian industrial workers.  
A population boom at the end of the 19th century, a harsh growing season due to Russia’s northern climate, and a series of costly wars—starting with the Crimean War—created frequent food shortages across the vast empire. Moreover, a famine in 1891-1892 is estimated to have killed up to 400,000 Russians.  
The devastating Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 further weakened Russia and the position of ruler Czar Nicholas II. Russia suffered heavy losses of soldiers, ships, money and international prestige in the war, which it ultimately lost.  
Many educated Russians, looking at social progress and scientific advancement in Western Europe and North America, saw how growth in Russia was being hampered by the monarchical rule of the czars and the czar’s supporters in the aristocratic class.  
Russian Revolution of 1905 \- Soon, large protests by Russian workers against the monarchy led to the Bloody Sunday massacre of 1905\. Hundreds of unarmed protesters were killed or wounded by the czar’s troops.  
The Bloody Sunday massacre sparked the Russian Revolution of 1905, during which angry workers responded with a series of crippling strikes throughout the country. Farm labourers and soldiers joined the cause, leading to the creation of worker-dominated councils called “soviets.”  
In one famous incident, the crew of the battleship Potemkin staged a successful mutiny against their overbearing officers. Historians would later refer to the 1905 Russian Revolution as ‘the Great Dress Rehearsal,” as it set the stage for the upheavals to come.”  
White Russian \- A white Russian émigré was a Russian subject who emigrated from the territory of the former Russian Empire in the wake of the Russian Revolution (1917) and Russian Civil War (1917–1923), and who was in opposition to the revolutionary (Red Communist) Russian political climate.  
A grace-and-favour home \- a residential property owned by a monarch by virtue of his or her position as head of state and leased, often rent-free, to persons as part of an employment package or in gratitude for past services rendered. In the United Kingdom, these homes are owned by the Crown or a charity and, in modern times, are often within the gift of the prime minister. Most of these properties are taxed as a "benefit in kind", although this status does not apply to 10 Downing Street or any home granted for security purposes

Flower and Dean Street \- Flower and Dean Street was a road at the heart of the Spitalfields rookery in the East End of London. It was one of the most notorious slums of the Victorian era, being described in 1883 as “perhaps the foulest and most dangerous street in the whole metropolis,” and was closely associated with the victims of Jack the Ripper.  
Spitalfields \- a district in the East End of London and within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The area is formed around Commercial Street (on the A1202 London Inner Ring Road) and includes the locale around Brick Lane, Christ Church, Toynbee Hall and Commercial Tavern. It has several markets, including Spitalfields Market, the historic Old Spitalfields Market, Brick Lane Market and Petticoat Lane Market. It was part of the ancient parish of Stepney in the county of Middlesex and was split off as a separate parish in 1729\. Just outside the City of London, the parish became part of the Metropolitan Board of Works area in 1855 as part of the Whitechapel District.  
The Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW) \- the principal instrument of London-wide government from December 1855 until the establishment of the London County Council in March 1889\. Its principal responsibility was to provide infrastructure to cope with London's rapid growth, which it accomplished. The MBW was **an appointed rather than elected body.** This lack of accountability made it unpopular with Londoners, especially in its latter years when it **fell prey to corruption.**  
The Spitalfields Tenterground \- established in the 17th century by Flemish weavers, who were Huguenot refugees fleeing religious persecution. Their weaving industry led to the area becoming a centre of the garment industry (the rag trade as it became known colloquially), with names such as Fashion Street and Petticoat Lane still extant. It was originally an area of open ground about 150 yards square, surrounded by the weavers' houses and workshops in White's Row, Wentworth Street, Bell Lane and Rose Lane (the last of which no longer exists). By the 19th century, the Flemish weavers had dispersed, and in 1829 the Tenterground was developed for housing. From about 1850, it was populated by Dutch Jews (see Chuts), to be joined later by Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in eastern Europe (see pogrom).  
Tenterground, tenter ground or teneter-field \- an area used for drying newly manufactured cloth after fulling. The wet cloth was hooked onto frames called tenters and stretched taut so that the cloth would dry flat and square. It is from this process that some have the expression "on tenterhooks", meaning in a state of nervous tension. There were tentergrounds wherever cloth was made, and as a result the word "tenter" is found in place names throughout the United Kingdom and its empire, for example several streets in Spitalfields, London and Tenterfield House in Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland, which is turn gave its name to Tenterfield in New South Wales, Australia.  
**Limehouse (Docks)** \- In 1766, the Limehouse Bridge Dock was constructed for barges and small ships to access the ‘Limehouse Cut’, which was a man-made canal that led further inland to the River Lee. Although most of the trading ships cargoes were unloaded further up the Thames at the Pool of London – the ‘Limehouse Basin’ was opened in 1820 as the Regent’s Canal Dock, specifically to transport unloaded smaller goods and cargo, on to barges on the Regent’s Canal – making Limehouse an important connection between the Thames and the canal systems, where cargoes could be transferred from larger ships to the smaller canal boats. Chinese sailors generally traded in tea and opium, and the area became notorious for its opium dens. It was also **famous for its Chinese Laundry's** – and as a result the area developed its own Chinatown district – the first in London.  
Public house, byname pub \- an establishment providing alcoholic beverages to be consumed on the premises. The traditional pub is an establishment found primarily in Britain and regions of British influence.  
West India Docks \- Built into the Isle of Dogs, for ships to dock and unload passengers and merchandise (initially from West India). Construction work of the two original West India Docks was sanctioned in 1799 by Parliament. They were built by the West India Dock Company for trade with the West Indies in tobacco, rice, wine, brandy and rum. Laying of the first stone took place on 12 July 1800\. The Isle of Dogs was at that time mostly open meadowland where cows were grazed, with ship-breakers’ yards, rope-makers and timber merchants along the riverside. The civil engineer William Jessop (also responsible for the Grand Junction Canal from the Midlands to London) was commissioned to create the docks and warehouses. He in turn left much of the work to Ralph Walker, one of those who had originally proposed the docks. The Scottish engineer John Rennie acted as a consultant and he introduced steam power for both the construction work and the dockside cranage.  
East India Trading Co. \- This company rose to account for half of the world's trade during the mid-1700s and early 1800s, particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, sugar, salt, spices, saltpetre, tea, and opium. The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India. The company eventually came to rule large areas of India, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions. Company rule in India effectively began in 1757 after the Battle of Plassey and lasted until 1858 when, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control of India in the form of the new British Raj. Despite frequent government intervention, the company had recurring problems with its finances. The company was dissolved in 1874 as a result of the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act enacted one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete. The official government machinery of British Raj (the rule of the British Crown on the Indian subcontinent from 1858 to 1947, AKA Crown rule, or direct rule) had assumed its governmental functions and absorbed its armies.  
**Rookery** \- a dense collection of housing, especially in a slum area. "they congregate cheek by jowl in unwholesome rookeries chosen for cheapness and convenience" Also— a colloquial English term given in the 18th and 19th centuries to a city slum occupied by poor people and frequently also by criminals and prostitutes. Such areas were overcrowded, with low-quality housing and little or no sanitation. Poorly constructed dwellings, built with multiple storeys and often crammed into any area of open ground, created densely-populated areas of gloomy, narrow streets and alleyways.  
Rag-and-bone shop \- A dealership selling cheap unwanted second-hand goods, or bric-a-brac, that have been collected for nothing as disposable items.  
Theatre Royal Haymarket (AKA Haymarket Theatre or the Little Theatre) \- West End theatre on Haymarket in the City of Westminster which dates back to 1720, making it the third-oldest London playhouse still in use. Samuel Foote acquired the lease in 1747, and in 1766 he gained a royal patent to play legitimate drama (meaning spoken drama, as opposed to opera, concerts or plays with music) in the summer months.  
‘French Mexico’ \- French immigration to Mexico started after Mexican independence in 1821, as foreign immigration was prohibited by Spanish authorities under the colonial regime. The first wave of French immigration occurred in the 1830s, following the country's recognition by France, with the foundation of a French colony on the Coatzacoalcos River, in Veracruz. 668 settlers were brought from France to populate the colony. Now there’s \~10,000 French Mexicans in the state of Veracruz.

The Breamore Mizmaze is thought to date to the 12th or 13th centuries. It was used by the monks for penitential purposes.

#### *Fashion & Cosmetics*

[Goffered/Goffering](http://www.oldandinteresting.com/fluting-goffering-irons.aspx) \- ‘Anyone who's pressed clothes with an iron on a flat surface knows it's easy to make a crease. So how can you iron waves of ruffles and keep the flounces without flattening them? One solution was a goffering iron, also called an Italian or tally iron. This was like a metal test tube set horizontally on a stand. (See right) The tube was heated by inserting a metal poker-like rod, fresh from the stove or hearth. Then frilled cuffs and collars could be curled round the cylinder, and other trimmings, like ribbons, were moved across it. Some Victorians took pride in a display of expertly-ironed ruffles, and the well-dressed baby often had a bonnet trimmed with "Italian-ironed double frills", as mentioned by Charlotte Brontë in 1849.’ \[...\] ‘For rows of frilled trimming, crimping or goffering (gauffering) tongs could be used.

#### *The Forty Elephants*

Alice Diamond [‘Diamond Annie’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QZEnyZyYo4&ab_channel=WeirdHistory) \= led the gang out of The Elephant and Castle Pub in Southwark (suh-thuhk).  
Southwark is a London borough that lies south of the Docklands, and on the other side of the Thames.  
They ‘looked like elephants’ laden-down with the goods they stole from merchants, hidden  under their crinoline hoop skirts.  
Shoplifting ring — they donned coats with hidden pockets and went to the west end.   
The leader was called the Queen of the Forty Thieves or Queen of the Forty Elephants (first was Mary Carr, and may have been the founder; once known as the most dangerous woman in London  
Hoister \- shoplifter  
They posed as maids and robbed families blind after earning their trust  
Diamond Annie grew up on the Elephants’ turf, and took leadership at 20 years old. Her sister was also a member. She covered her hands in diamonds, giving her a punch to beware of, and she was taller than the average London man at the time, 5’9”  
She once slipped stolen jewels into a detective’s pockets during an interrogation.  
High-end establishments had a blind spot for people (thieves) in haute couture.  
One woman wore a false arm to keep her other free for stashing items in her coat  
The crush — a group would swarm a counter asking to see jewellery, passing the item down the line until one of them tucked it away. The others made a ruckus for a distraction and proclaimed their innocence so the pilferer could flee undetected.  
Another ruse was to try on a necklace so that a decoy could be made, and then swapped out on the next visit. Diamond Annie herself was once used in a distraction-ploy once her reputation was known, drawing attention from security so another Elephant could make off with things.  
They thrived for decades, buying fast cars that could outrun the coppers.   
Marie Britten fell in love and got pregnant and wanted to leave the gang and after she got married, Annie rallied a mob of the other Elephants and wailed on her husband. In her 18 mos. in jail, Gillian Rose Kendall took over. Known as the bobbed-hair bandit, she used a smash and grab technique, even smashing cars into storefronts. Annie didn’t fight back for her position, instead running a cathouse in Lambeth until she passed away in 1952

#### *Recreation & Entertainment*

Cremorne Gardens \- Popular pleasure gardens by the side of the River Thames in Chelsea, London.

Cremorne is also a ward of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.  
[Mazes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/29/how-the-worlds-foremost-maze-maker-leads-people-astray) \-   
**Chanteuse** \- a female singer of popular songs, especially in a nightclub  
Schumannn and his [finger-stretcher](https://www.wqxr.org/story/weird-classical-when-schumann-ruined-his-fingers-and-his-concert-career/) \- “The conventional story is that Schumann, either impatient with his progress or just that committed to being the absolute best, devised a finger strengthening mechanism out of a cigar box. The machine would bend back one finger and keep it in place, while allowing the user to exercise the other digits. There may be some credence to this — finger strengthening devices weren’t uncommon in the 1830s, and several of them were available for home use. Unfortunately, it didn’t work. Schumann wound up partially paralysing his right index and middle fingers in the hope of making them stronger. But there is plenty of room for scepticism. In 1971, musicologist Eric Sams presented research that, if not entirely dismissing the “finger box” as myth, at least casts suspicion on why he was using it. See, Schumann may very well have been suffering from syphilis at this time. It’s a terrible disease that, in the 19th century, would have been treated with mercury, which is poisonous. And one of the symptoms of mercury poisoning is a paralysis that begins in the muscles of the fingers and works its way up the forearm. If this were the case, Schumann may not have been looking to strengthen his fingers out of short sighted expectations to get better, faster; but because the strength in those fingers had already started to go.”

#### *Magic Lantern Shows*

Based on the Kinotropists in The Difference Engine — [Slide Archive](http://lucerna.exeter.ac.uk/slide/index.php?id=5061115)  
"Kinotrope" from DIFFERENCE ENGINE \- [SEE VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea7fH9gFDAk)   
[The slides](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/sep/27/how-victorians-saw-the-plight-of-the-poor-through-a-moral-lens) – originally paintings, later prints or photographs – were displayed on transparent plates that were illuminated using an image projector known as a **magic lantern**.  
*The Whiskey Demon: or the Dream of the Reveller, a set of 12 slides made by Alfred Pumphrey of Birmingham in the late 1800s.*  
Church ministers, activists and charity workers would have shown the slides at church halls, or at orphanages and workhouses, Kember explained. But they would have also been shown to middle-class audiences at fundraising events.  
Magic lanterns waned in popularity as cinema took off.   
The manipulation of light to produce an image dates back millennia. In the late 18th century, showmen used lanterns to produce horror shows, or phantasmagoria. Terrifying images were produced, including ghosts projected onto smoke and shapes that moved on walls.  
In the 1880s and 1890s, more than 30 firms were engaged in the production of lanterns and slides in London alone. As the shows gained in popularity, they were set to music or the spoken word.

### **Literary References \-** 

Primary influences are Victorian-era fiction and historical accounts, as well as Steampunk novels. Writers like HG Wells, Charles Dickens, and Jules Verne are especially of note. It’s important that the fictional world is rooted in historical accounts, and that science fiction and magic elements should be based on actual scientific principles, while any magic is representative of mysticism and superstition at the time.

Books Include: League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Dracula, Frankenstein, Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Who, To Say Nothing of the Dog, Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Lady Mechanika, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, various works by Charles Dickens, works by [R.F.

- Charles Booth wrote “Life and Labour of the People in London” — a multi-volume book surveying the lives and occupations of the working class of late 19th century London.  
- From a police notebook that was collected in Booth’s time — “North up Gravel Lane across bridge separating the East from the West basin of the \[St. Katherine\] London Docks. This and the other bridge in New Gravel Lane are called the Bridge of Sighs because of the numbers of suicides. A policeman is now stationed there between 3pm and 7am each day as a preventive. There has been a lull in the number the last 2 years but they (suicides) used to be very frequent.” — George H. Duckworth’s Notebook: Police and Publican District 7

“It’s a knowledge guild,” he said soberly. “The bosses, the big’uns, they can take all manner of things away from us. With their bloody laws and factories and courts and banks.… They can make the world to their pleasure, they can take away your home and kin and even the work you do.…” Mick shrugged angrily, his lean shoulders denting the heavy fabric of the greatcoat. “And even rob a hero’s daughter of her virtue, if I’m not too bold in speaking of it.” He pressed her hand against his sleeve, a hard, trapping grip. “But they can’t ever take what you know, now can they, Sybil? They can’t ever take that.” (19)  
“Kinotrope” \- original vernacular meaning \- a display of wooden widgets of undescribed dimensions that by means of the machine rotated or were swapped out to act as pixels and display images and text. They are used in The Difference Engine in place of/in conjunction with stage theater, public lecture (i.e. powerpoint) and as a means of advertisement and news reports. The pieces of wood made a distinct clacking noise as they transitioned from one position to another lending the programmers that operated them the title "clackers".

“**At length** there came the rap of a cane against the door. A second of Mick’s friends had arrived. This was a heavyset man of quite astonishing ugliness, pop-eyed and blue-jowled, his squat, sloping forehead fringed in an oiled parody of the elegant spit-curls the Prime Minister favored. The stranger wore a new and well-cut evening dress, with cloak, cane and top-hat, a fancy pearl in his cravat and a gold Masonic ring on one finger.” (35)

“acidulated lemon-drop”  
“There were other soldiers speckled through the crowd, bright in their red coats, the respectable sort, who didn’t go for drabs and gin, but would take the Queen’s pay, and learn gunnery arithmetic, and come back to work in the railroads and shipyards, and better themselves.

“Confederates tended to dress rather gaudy and flash, but peculiar, not quite proper; to judge by Houston, the Texians were an even queerer and madder lot.” (42)  
“his broad shoulders draped in a long, coarse-woven blanket rather like a mantelet, but barbarically striped. Red and black and umber, it swept the Garrick’s stage like a tragediean’s toga. He had a thick mahogany cane in his right hand, and he swung it lightly now, as if he didn’t need it, but his legs shook, Sybil saw, and the gold fringe trembled on the fancy seams of his trousers.” (42)  
“the screen’s bits flickering, row by row, like falling dominoes. A portrait bust appeared in shaded jagged lines: \[...\] The thin mouth was set firmly, the cleft chin upraised. \[...\] He had the deep booming voice of a practiced orator, marred by a foreign drawl. \[...\] limelight glittered harshly from the medals clinging to his coat.”

“‘The heart within this scarred breast,’ he said, and thumped it, ‘still stirs to that noblest of stories, with its tales of a valor to challenge the very gods, and of unstained martial honor that endures… till death\!’” (44)  
“two of the kinotrope bits in the screen’s upper-left-corner had jammed on their spindles, showing dots of left-over blue; a tiny fault but annoying all out of proportion, like a bit of dust in one’s eye. Mick’s fancy clacking was working the Garrick’s kino very hard.” (45)  
“‘an honest soldier of the people, who valued a man’s true inner worth above the tinsel of wealth or show,’”  
“...a tinted glass filter, the sudden booming of a kettle-drum, as little kino cannons cracked gunpowder-white around the fort, and single-bit flickers of red cannon-shell arched rapidly across the screen.” (46)  
“A tiny figure dashed toward the fort, no more than a few black squares, a wriggling block of bits,”  
“He’d lain all night on the battlefield, he claimed, and then been hauled for days through wilderness, on a supply cart, bleeding, raving, sick with swamp-fever” (46)

“‘The tattling mouths of libel poured their venom on me.’”  
“General Houston was a foreigner, after all, half a savage by his own account; but when he spoke of his wife it was tenderly, as of a true love, a love slain by some cruel mysterious truth.” (48)  
“leopard-skin vest”  
“he wasn't a bad-looking cove, over sixty but that sort could be kinder to a girl.”  
“She chided herself”  
“some good-looking Tennessee beau-trap \[...\] Men had hard rules for their brides, if never for themselves.”  
“Or perhaps he'd milled his wife about with his fists—for Sybil fancied he'd be **a right bully-rock**, in his cups.” (49)  
“slanderers, those who'd smeared his precious honor with the ink of a gutter press. Nasty crooky-back things, crowding the screen in devilish black and red. As the screen whirred steadily, they twitched their cloven hooves. Never had she seen the like, some Manchester punch-card artist having gotten the gin-horrors sure…”  
“He had a real head of steam up, now; he'd stoked himself so, it was almost frightening to watch. The audience was entertained, their reserve broken by his bulging eyes and veiny Texian neck, but none too far from disgust.”  
“rabbit-skin muff”  
“Maybe it was lady's-fever, that he'd given his own wife a case of the glue. Some types of glue were horrible, and could make you mad, or blind, or crippled.”  
“‘no roads greater than the grassy tracks of Indians. Without, at that time, a single mile of British railroad, and lacking the telegraph, or, indeed, Engine resources of any kind.’” (50)  
“Travis, Bowie, and Crockett each had a third of the kino screen, their faces gone strangely square with the cramped scale of their depiction”  
“the kinotrope wound slowly down, its flickering domino-tricks whirring to a stop, leaving San Jacinto frozen in mid-victory. Houston fixed Sybil with a look of mingled sternness and resignation.” (51)  
“She groped quickly in memory, picking up the thread. ‘General Houston\! I'm a defenseless woman, but you're a man of destiny, a man of greatness\! Can't there be justice for Texas, sir? Some redress for these affronts? Must my poor brother die there in misery, while cheats and tyrants steal our British property?’" (53)  
“evening-jackets \[...\] gardenia perfume” (54)  
“Oh heaven, Sybil thought, shrinking, the fat mama from the row before her, with that intolerable oily look of a good woman doing her moral duty. A little thrill of shame and disgust shot through her. For a moment she felt genuinely weak, sinking with a buttery ease into the warmth of their concern, a half-dozen busybodies muttering around her in a shared pretense of competence, while Houston thundered on above them, hoarse with indignation.” (54)  
“‘I shall see the lady home,’ he piped at the others. He shrugged into an opera cape, perched a tall beaver hat on his head, and lent her his arm.”  
“flaking gilt cupids and damp-marked faux-marble walls.”  
“His cheeks were flushed, twin hot points of red.” (55)  
"’This London air will be the death of me.’" (55)  
“He drew a ticking silver chronometer from his waistcoat, a many-dialed thing the size of a small potato, and consulted it. ‘I'm not familiar with the district,’ he said distantly. ‘I'd thought to hail you a cabriolet, but at this hour…’” (55)  
“No respectable woman rode the underground unescorted.”  
“While the screen's resolution is quite modest, and the refresh-rate positively slow, remarkable effects have been secured, one presumes through algorithmic compression—but I fear that is all a bit technical.” (55-56)  
“‘I might escort you to the local omnibus stand—'tis a railless carriage, you see…’" (56)  
“Just then a skinny boy sidled rapidly up behind them, brushed past, and out of the theatre without a word. He was draped in a long dirty coat of canvas, something a fisherman might wear. A singular thing to wear to a lecture, Sybil thought, though one saw queerer garments on the poor; the sleeves flapped emptily, as though the boy were hugging himself, against a chill perhaps. His gait was odd, bent-backed, as if he were drunk or ill.”  
“The installation of exhaust-fans, said the Daily Telegraph, had wrought a perceptible improvement in the atmosphere of the Metropolitan, though Lord Babbage himself held that a truly modern underground railway would operate on **pneumatic** principles exclusively, involving no combustion whatever, rather in the way mail was conveyed throughout Paris.” (57)  
“breathing as shallowly as possible, Sybil knew it all for humbug, or in any case the improvement part, for who knew what marvels the Rads mightn't bring forth? But hadn't the Rad papers also published the testimony of medicals, in the pay of the railroad, that sulphurous fumes were therapeutic for asthma? And it wasn't only the fumes from the Engines, but vile sewer-seepings as well, and gassy leakings from collapsible India-rubber bags, that lit the carriage-jets in their wire-netted glass shades.”   
“they worked unceasingly, the excavators, boring newer, deeper lines now, down below the tangle of sewers and gas-pipes and bricked-over rivers. The new lines were shored with steel, and soon Lord Babbage's smokeless trains would slide through them silent as eels, though she found the thought of it somehow unclean.  
“The lamps flared all at once, the flow of gas disturbed by a particularly sharp jolt, the faces of the other passengers seeming to leap out at her: the sallow gent with something of the successful publican about him, the round-cheeked old Quaker cleric, the drunken dandy with his coat open, his canary waistcoat all dotted down the front with claret…”  
“\[...\] the tuppenny trip back to Whitechapel…”  
“But the clergyman had noticed her, his contempt quite open, there for anyone to see.” (57-58)  
“Sharp frost shone in pools of gas-light on the street’s new macadam.” (58)  
“Nearly **recumbent** within the creaking frame of a four-wheeled velocipede, his shoes were strapped to whirling cranks and his breath puffed explosively into the cold. He was bare-headed and goggled, in a thick striped jersey, a long knit scarf flapping out behind him as he sped away. Sybil supposed him an inventor.” (58)  
“In a week's time she'd encountered a wicked-looking device meant to crimp hair by electricity, a child's mechanical top that played Beethoven, and a scheme for electroplating the dead.” (59)  
“The cobbles of London were vanishing month by month, paved over with black stuff that poured stinking hot from the maws of great wagons, for navvies to spread and smooth with rakes, before the advance of the steam-roller.” (58)  
“A coin-fed wagering-machine”   
“steep dark stairs, that climbed below a sooty skylight to an alcove presenting a pair of identical doors.” (59)  
“...the wick in need of trimming”  
“\[Toby\] batted at the ribbons of her bonnet.” (60)  
“The hallway had seen no sunlight in all the years the Hart had stood, yet the printed flowers were gone a shade like dust.”  
“Sybil's room had two windows, though they opened on a blank wall of grimed yellow brick, so near she could've touched it, if someone hadn't driven nails into the casements. Still, on a bright day, with the sun directly overhead, a bit of light did filter in. And Hetty's room, though larger, had only one window.”  
“...an engraving from Crimea on the front \[of the newspaper\], a scene of a city all aflame.”  
“She took a wick-trimmer from the commode's drawer, raised the lamp's chimney, and scissored away the blackened bit. The light somewhat improved.” (60)  
“...after setting aside two changes of undergarments, it came to her that the less she took, the more Dandy Mick would have to buy for her in Paris. And if that wasn't thinking like a 'prentice adventuress, she didn't know what was.” (61)  
“a green paste brooch”  
“a miniature flower-press with a souvenir view of Kensington Palace, and a patent German curling-iron she'd nicked from a hair-dresser's. She added a bone-handled tooth-brush and a tin of camphorated dentifrice.”  
“On the mantel lay a flat tin, brightly lithographed with the name of a Strand tobacconist. \[...\] Sybil generally avoided medical students. They prided themselves on **studied beastliness**. But now, in the grip of a powerful nervous impulse, she opened the tin, drew out one of the crisp paper cylinders, and inhaled its fierce perfume.”  
“...a cigarette was the thing to steel a gambler's nerve.”  
“\[She\] was rewarded with an acrid portion of vile smoke that set her wracking like a consumptive.”  
“She scraped her shin cruelly in the dark…”  
“She'd twigged him from a block away, climbing down from her cabriolet—a big gold-braided bugaboo, lurking on the hotel's marble steps under great dolphin-wreathed lamps. She knew her doormen well enough; they played a major role in her life.”  
“Smash a window with a cobblestone, and run past him when he came to look. It was hard to run in a crinoline, but he was lame, and slow. Or find a street-boy to throw a stone for her…”  
“Pure luck, it seemed, rescued her then, or the nod of a sorrowing angel, for a shining gurney brougham came to a chugging halt in front of Grand's, its **blue-coated fireman** jumping down to lower the hinged step. Out came a rollicking mob of drunken Frenchmen in scarlet-lined capes, with brocade waistcoats and tasseled **evening-canes**...” (64)   
“gleaming coachwork”  
“wood-spoked wheels with their treads of rubber”  
“The Frenchies were parley-vousing at each other, mustache-stroking and giggling”  
“linteled mahogany”  
“The night-clerk obligingly produced a sheet of cream-laid hotel stationery and proffered his gold-nibbed reservoir-pen.” (66)  
“Shortly, a yawning and sour-faced little page appeared and placed her note on a cork-topped salver.”  
“He heaved one-handed at the smoking-room door. As it opened…”  
“a wicked-looking jackknife”  
“...warmth stealing through her damp, grimy shoes; her toes began to ache.”  
“the page emerged with Mick on his heels, Mick smiling back into the smoking-room and sketching out a cheery half-salute.”  
“‘Bit of a contretemps. I'm afraid. Case of the fox biting his own arse.’”  
“‘Try arguing that with Samuel bloody Houston\! He stole a whole damn country once, stole it clean and picked it to the bone\!’”  
“She'd never seen Mick really drunk before, and now he was lushed, lightning-struck”  
“‘Go to that counter-man, blarney him.’”  
“The Grand's telegraph stood at the far end, a ticking brass machine on a low marble pedestal decorated with leafy gilt vines. Within a sort of bell-glass, a gilded needle swung to and fro, pointing out letters in a concentric alphabet. With every twitch of the needle, something in the marble base clunked methodically, causing another quarter-inch of neatly perforated yellow paper tape to emerge from the marble base.” (69)  
“Sybil had not been looking for Mick. She had been afraid to look. Now, from the corner of her eye, she saw a dark form scuttle across the lobby floor. Mick was bent almost double, with his shoes off, the laces knotted around his neck. He charged headlong at the waist-high mahogany counter, grabbed the forward edge two-handed, vaulted over it in a split-second, and vanished.” (70)  
“She remembered his face well enough, fatuous and successful, which always looked as though it meant well, always apologized, always preached at her, and whined, and begged, and wept, and sinned. He was a fool. \[...\]” “If she were clever, she should walk out of the Grand Hotel, vanish into the depths of London, and never see Radley again. She should not let the 'prentice oath hold her. To break an oath was frightening, but no more vile than her other sins. Yet somehow here she was; she had let him do with her as he would.” (72)  
“Why was she doing this? Because Mick was strong, and she was weak? Because he knew secrets that she didn't? For the first time, it occurred to her that she might be in love with him. Perhaps she did love him, in some strange way, and if that were true, it might explain matters to her, in a way which was almost soothing. If she were in love, she had a right to burn her bridges, to walk on air, to live by impulse. And if she loved Radley, it was finally something she knew, which he didn't. Her secret alone.” (73)  
“There was a lamp in the room somewhere. She could smell its burnt wick. \[...\] ...between the curtains a faint knife-slice of upwashed gas-light. **She faltered her way into the room**, hands outstretched”  
“Her fingers brushed a box of lucifers, which she recognized less by touch than by the dry familiar rattle. Her fingers, really, didn't seem to be working properly.”  
“She saw her own lamp-lit reflection staring wild-eyed from tilted cheval-glass, then doubled in beveled mirrors set into the twin doors of a wardrobe.” (74)  
“The slow Texian voice slid forth like treacle \[...\] The slow voice was heavy with gallows certainty.”  
“‘You must be lonely here in London,’ Sybil blurted, desperate to avoid another silence. ‘Maybe Houston's lonesome. I got a better conscience.’” (75)  
(Wind-up rifle/guns \- *I guess* what you would consider a highly-mechanized automaton-firearm.)  
"’Massacred the Alamo. Burned all the bodies… Massacred the Meir Expedition. Made 'em pick beans. Little clay lottery pot, pull out a black bean and they kill you. That's Mexicans for you.’"  
“Black beans. Goliad. **Her head was a Babel.** Beans and massacre and this man whose skin was like leather. He stank like a navvy, of horses and sweat.” (76)  
“Where could such a man hide, even in London, even amid the tattered hordes of American refugees?” (77)  
“And all that happened after, in that room, was a dream to Sybil, or a play she watched, or some kino-show wrought with balsa-bits so numerous, so tiny, and so cleverly worked, as to blur reality.”  
(Balsa-bits \- small, individual parts of a kinotrope that make up the image)  
“‘Come out, you little whelp.’”  
“Her room above the Hart seemed distant as childhood's first memories, here in the smell of slaughter, in this dark where giants moved—Houston reeled suddenly to slash at the curtains with his cane, tore them open, gas-light catching the patterns of frost on the glass of each mullioned pane, illuminating the Texian's kerchief and the grim eyes above it, **eyes distant and merciless as winter stars**. Houston staggered at the sight, the striped blanket sliding from his shoulders. His medals gleamed, quivered. ‘Rangers sent me, Sam.’ Mick's little pepperbox pistol looked a toy in the Texian's hand, the clustered barrels winking as he took aim.” (79)  
“Mick's little pepperbox pistol looked a toy in the Texian's hand, the clustered barrels winking as he took aim.” (79)  
“his voice a rich syrup of patience and sincerity,”  
“Sybil rose, and walked, giddily, toward the door. Her foot squelched moistly in the red-splashed shadows by the wardrobe, and she looked down, to see an open card-case in red morocco, with a pair of tickets in a heavy nickel-plate clip. She stooped, picked it up.” (81)  
“South-Eastern Railway Company's London Bridge Terminus was a vast drafty hall of iron and **soot-blown glass.**”  
“Quakers moved among the avenues of benches, offering pamphlets to the seated travelers. Red-coated Irish soldiers, **red-eyed from the night's gin**, glowered at the close-shaven missionaries as they passed. The French passengers all seemed to be returning home with pineapples, **sweet exotic bounty** from the docks of London.” (82)

“The Central Statistics Bureau, vaguely pyramidal in form and excessively Egyptianate in its ornamental detail, squatted solidly in the governmental heart of Westminster, its uppermost stories slanting to a limestone apex. For the sake of increased space, the building's lower section was swollen out-of-true, like some great stone turnip. Its walls, pierced by towering smokestacks, supported a scattered forest of spinning ventilators, their vanes annoyingly hawk-winged. "The whole vast pile was riddled top to bottom with thick black telegraph-lines, as though individual streams of the Empire's information had bored through solid stone. A dense growth of wiring swooped down, from conduits and brackets, to telegraph-poles crowded thick as the rigging in a busy harbor.” (127)

“his mind hot with insight” (157)  
“His senses almost left him; he felt himself fall, but caught himself against the filthy cobblestones with arms as numb and heavy as legs of mutton.” (160)  
“It came out in his hand like a long oiled snake. A truncheon, **with a braided leather handle and a thick black shaft of India-rubber**, flattened at the end to a swollen tip like a shoehorn's. It had a spring-steel whippiness, as if it were built around a coil of iron.”

“The bonds of society broken, they had simply flown apart, like the perfectly elastic gassy spheres in Boyle's Laws of Physics. Most of them looked respectable enough by their dress; they were merely reckless now, stripped by Chaos to a moral vacuity. Most of them, Mallory thought, had never seen any event remotely like this one. They had no proper standards left for judgment or comparison. They had become puppets of base impulse.”  
“...in the devil's grip of drink, the goodmen of civilized London had surrendered themselves to primitive madness.

“‘A better end than any you can make with that pistol I see peeping from your trouser-band,’”

“His head spun evilly.” \[...\] “weak in his very marrow”  
“When he juggled up the bills again, their paper wrinkled in his sweating hands **like the peeling skin of a drowned man.**”  
“He had, it seemed, frustrated a lashing bite of the tout's hydra-headed devilment. But this minor triumph seemed wretchedly small, when matched against the villain's seemingly endless reservoirs of wicked ingenuity. Mallory was stumbling in darkness—while torn at will by invisible fangs…”

“The gears of his life would begin to mesh once more in order.”

“...Brian fixed Fraser with a soldier's steely eye.”  
“‘It seems the fated time for risks,’ he admitted, with a lopsided shrug, and a passing wince. \[...\] ‘...I daresay I'm due for a change of fortune.’”

“Pitched battles with brickbats and pistols were raging in Lambeth”  
“**Reports had it** that the Bedlam Hospital had been thrown open, its unchained lunatics capering the streets in frenzy.”  
“Volunteers of the respectable classes were being deputized in the West End, and equipped with batons and rifles. \[...\] Beyond authority's battered boundary, things grew swiftly more grim.”  
“crowds were clustering like flies in the crossroads of the city.”  
“...commandeered omnibuses patrolled Cheapside, crammed with **hard-faced bruisers**. Men waving pistols hung from the running-boards, and the roofs of both steamers were piled high and bristling with stolen furniture.”  
“...shoeless children clambering like monkeys, four stories in the air, on the red-painted arm of a great construction-crane. Spies of a sort, Brian opined, for some were waving colored rags and screeching down at people in the street.” (272)  
“...each site of rapturous looting now surrounded by a pungent, fly-blown stickiness of spillage.”  
“...a leprous plague of bills, slapped-up at the site of this drunken orgy.”  
“ The four of them, with a wary **eye for interference**…”

“...asked Mallory, his head buzzing.”  
“...with life and death awaiting the coming roll of the die, there seemed little enough to say.”  
“An inexplicable weariness of soul struck him, as the Zephyr rumbled on unchallenged through the macadamed streets. It was a very weariness of London, of the city's sheer physicality, its nightmare endlessness, of streets, courts, crescents, terraces, and alleys, of fog-shrouded stone and soot-blackened brick. A nausea of awnings, a nastiness of casements, an ugliness of scaffoldings lashed together with rope; a horrible prevalence of iron street-lamps and granite bollards, of pawn-shops, haberdashers, and tobacconists. The city seemed to stretch about them like some pitiless abyss of geologic time.”  
“...seemed to Mallory a moment of true splendor.” \[...\] “utterly free of doubt.”  
“...with a face like dirty dough, in a greasy jacket and corduroy trousers, had a mangy fur cap pulled low, but not low enough to hide the **prison-cut** of his hair.”  
“a tall **grease-stiffened hat**, checked trousers, and brass-toed lace-up boots.”  
“asked Fraser, scenting deceit” \[...\] “‘**E’s** from New York’”

“‘Britain's a sight too hospitable to all these damn foreign refugees. If I'd my way, I'd transport the lot to Texas…’”  
“They reached an obstacle a few yards on, a dredger's muddy hollow, half-filled with black silt, marbled with veins of vile pale grease like the lees from a pan of bacon. There was no help for it but to leap and dodge and splash across the ditch…” (284)  
“**worse luck yet** at the entrance-channel”  
“‘Our number's up—sell your lives dear, lads\!’”  
“But in one moment—a series of instants shaved so thin as to be normally useless to the human mind—inspiration blew through Mallory like a gust of Alpine wind.”  
“with a boozy wave of his arm.”  
“in the elaborate tone of a man casting pearls of wit before swine.”  
“‘Just how very lushed, how utterly well-pissed indeed, can four London pigeons be?’”  
“standing in stinking mud, believing a stinking lie”  
“A thick, tarred rope” \[...\] “struck a pose, chin cocked”  
“‘...in command of this vipers' crew\!’”  
“‘You'd carry it back to your rat-warren,’ the Marquess surmised, ‘and sell it for a fraction of its worth to a fencing-Jew, and spend the lot of that on drink, to wake, in a day or two, in a filthy station-house, with a copper's foot on your neck.’”  
“We shall use it in the cause of those who gave it value. By that, I mean the common-folk of London, the masses, the oppressed, **the sweated labor**, those who produce all the riches of this city.”  
“You could own London, the modern Babylon herself\! You could own futurity\!"  
“‘Futurity,' eh?’ said Mallory, glancing back at Fraser. Above his gingham mask the policeman's eyes showed **unmitigated loathing**. Mallory shrugged. ‘How much tin will a quart of 'futurity' fetch, Yer Lordship?’” (292)  
“‘They have liquidated the rich. They have burned Trinity\! They have seized the means of information and production. If mere Yankees can do that, then the people of England, far more advanced along the course of historical development, can do it with even greater ease.’”  
“‘We stand in the heart of the British capital, the one area on Earth that Britain's imperial elite are unwilling to devastate in the pursuit of their evil hegemony.’”  
**\[GAP (book and paper annotations only) from 292 to 340\]**  
“penknife on his watch-chain” 340

“the Police des Châteaux, the bodyguard and secret personal agency of the Emperor Napoleon.” \[I believe this is made up\].  
“Two men from Criminal Anthropometry, no more than usually cryptic about their purposes, employed large squares of tissue-thin adhesive grid-paper to capture various hairs and bits of fluff from the carpet”

“‘There are men who can read cards, Oliphant. But even a junior clerk can read the directive primaries as easily as you read the kinos in the underground.’ ‘I never read the kinos in the underground, Andrew.’ Wakefield snorted. Oliphant knew this to be his equivalent of laughter. ‘And how are things among the *corps diplomatique*, Mr. Oliphant? Coping with our 'Luddite conspiracy,' are we?’ It would have been impossible to mistake the man's sarcasm, but Oliphant pretended to take him quite literally. ‘It really hasn't had too great an effect, as yet. Not among my own areas of special interest.’ \[...\] On Oliphant's request, Wakefield regularly ordered the files spun on groups as diverse as the Carbonari, the Knights of the White Camellia, the Fenian Society, the Texas Rangers, the Greek Hetairai, the Pinkerton Detective Agency, and the Confederate Bureau of Scientific Research, all of whom were known to be operative in Britain.” 346  
“Wakefield automatically ran a gloved fingertip across the lines of punch-holes, checking for indications of wear that might cause mechanical difficulties.”  
“On the down-stroke, the device thumped like a shopman's **credit-press**.”  
“‘...your friends from the Special Branch trooping in hourly, demanding that our brass be spun and spun again, in hope of shaking loose these Luddites alleged to be lodged in the nation's rafters\!’” 349  
“furled umbrella”  
“precisely aligned with the table’s edge.” 351  
“‘The Manhattan Women's Red Pantomime Troupe,’ Oliphant said at last. Kriege snorted derisively. ‘The Bowery's Sapphic best, come to London? I remember them in Purdy's National. They wooed and won the Dead Rabbits to the cause, whose sole previous involvement with politics had consisted of rock-fights and punch-ups in municipal elections. The butcher-boys, the bootblacks, the prostitutes of Chatham Square and the Five Points, that was their audience. Sweaty proletarians, come to see a woman shot out of a gun, flattened against a wall, and peeled off like paper… I tell you, sir, your interest is misplaced.’”  
“Oliphant sighed. ‘My friend, it is my job to ask questions. You must understand that I cannot tell you my reasons for asking a given question…’”  
“‘You knew Mr. Marx intimately, I believe." In order to extract a given piece of information from Kriege, he knew, it was necessary to engage the man's dominant passion. ‘Knew him? I was there to greet him off the boat. He embraced me, and not a minute later had borrowed twenty gold dollars, to pay his rent in the Bronx\!’ Kriege assayed a sort of laugh, strangled with abiding rage. ‘He'd his Jenny with him, then, though the marriage didn't survive the revolution… But he'd a Brooklyn Irish factory-girl in his bed when he expelled me from the Commune, sir, for preaching 'religionism and free-love'\! Free-love indeed\!’”  
“Kriege had been a member of the Commune's so-called "Central Committee," before Marx had sent him packing. With a price on his head in the Northern Union, he had sailed in steerage from Boston, penniless, under an assumed name, with his wife and child, to join London's thousands of American refugees.” (352)  
**\[RAT BAITING BAR\]**  
“a public house known as the Blue Boar. ‘A SPORTING-GENTLEMAN,’ he was informed by a large bill, ‘a Staunch Supporter of the destruction of these Vermin,’ would give ‘A GOLD REPEATER-WATCH TO BE KILLED FOR BY DOGS under 13 3/4 pounds weight.’ Below the smudged bill, a painted wooden placard advertised ‘Rats always on hand for the accommodation of Gentlemen to try their dogs.’ He entered, and shortly was greeting Fraser in the rank smell of dogs, tobacco-smoke, and **hot** **penny-gin**. The long bar was crowded with **men of every grade of society**, many with their animals under their arms. "There were bull-dogs, Skye terriers, small brown English terriers. The room was low-ceilinged and quite unadorned. About the walls were hung clusters of leather collars.” 353

“She’s just jealous, I thought out of habit, like it would give me a name for my own worry”  
“Then he reached behind him for something hidden at his waist, and I remembered that the first thing he’d ever made disappear was his gun.”

“When she used that tone, you gave way, and so I closed my mouth and kept it closed.”

Boss said, ‘Then they can be afraid of it.’

#### *Dialogue Programming & Testing*

- To Find Latest Stats \- Top menu of Unity, select Adventure Creator-\>Editors-\>Game Editor. In the popup window select the Variables tab, and there's a big list of variables that you can scroll through, which includes all the skills and their initial values.  
- Current Stats — Brute Force, 28, Protection, 22, Intimidation, 26, Combativeness, 20, Protection, 22, Impulse, 14, Recollection, 25, Deduction, 20, Persuasion, 18, Chemistry, 12, Mechanisms, 13, Fine-Motor, 20, Reflexes, 13, Hand-Eye, 17, Haste, 18, Stealth, 12, Discretion, 13, Conjuring, 30, Composure, 23, Diligence, 16, Constitution, 26, Vision, 10, Touch, 20, Hearing, 15, Smell, 25, Taste, 22, Blood, \-3, Phlegm, 4, Black Bile, 3, Yellow Bile, \-2  
- For AC-Delays, try the @ sign after a command to delay it by some number of seconds. So something like… AC(AutomatonWalk)@2.5  
- When using the @X functionality to delay actions, if that node also has a Continue(), we need to delay the Continue as well. If you delay action 1 and then say Continue(), we move to the next node and action 1 never happens. If ‘continue’ is tied for the longest delay and it's also listed last, it will happen last.  
- \-Hold "P" when selecting a skill check to pass regardless of card drawn.  
- \-Hold "F" when selecting a skill check to fail regardless of card drawn.  
- \-Hold "M" after drawing a non-face card to draw a major arcana card anyway.

#### *Various Reminders*

- Think ‘bidirectional’ with dialog trees, considering options for both Human and Minotaur forms.  
- EXT. RED LANTERN LANE \- NIGHT \-  (Add this area in later as one the Player can return to — will include the Chinese Laundry and the Red Lotus)  
- Jump from the Bridge of Sighs (if desired, for Atticus, or Clara, or both?)  
- Atticus has a ‘Bookmaker’ not a Bookie; distances should be in km  
- **Links to revisit \-** [1](http://www.michaelyoungkin.com/health-and-sanitary-conditions-in-london/#:~:text=During%20the%20Victorian%20Era%20in,Scarlet%20fever%2C%20Cholera%2C%20etc.&text=One%20of%20the%20biggest%20sanitary,horses%20and%20use%20of%20cesspools), [2](https://www.bl.uk/victorian-britain/articles/health-and-hygiene-in-the-19th-century), [3](https://londonist.com/2016/07/where-did-trafalgar-square-s-pigeons-come-from),

  The fancy (peculiar colored) rats were kept as pets by many members of high society, who organised various competitions, promoting the hobby well into the 20th century.  
- Cockney accent: glottal ‘T’ wa’er not ‘water.’ The ‘l’ that sounds like a ‘w’ — ‘piw’ not ‘pill’ and the schwa sound: Dawctah not ‘doctor.’  
- The night in the Brother Bedroom with Clara is less about sex, and more about desire for comfort and the personal, intimate connection that Atticus scarcely receives.

#### *Ideas / Concepts on the Chopping Block*

- Throwaway ‘Minotaur’ epithets \- bullywag, minnow, bullhead, hornhead, bully-rock.   
- If we do flashbacks of the birth it would be good to use chloroform and a midwife, could be part of the story that the father / husband had the woman locked up in the sanitarium because of her "crazy" stories about the abandoned minotaur child, especially if he was a high society illusionist that hid his minotaur background much like his son was forced to do.  
- We can have those in Governmental power be called the “Mods.” As in modernists, or modernizers. The labour party could be adversarial and have a luddite subgroup. (See list of political parties)  
- [**Professional mourners**](https://metro.co.uk/2017/10/21/now-you-can-hire-professional-mourners-for-your-funeral-and-its-not-as-strange-as-you-might-think-7002481/)**:** “Professional mourners were also recorded in China in a New York Times article from 1877 that refers to ‘customs in the Orient’ for ‘hired mourners’. It reads: ‘The custom undoubtedly has its advantages. When an objectionable uncle dies, leaving his nephew a large fortune, the latter can save himself the strain of mourning his departed relative by merely hiring a few loud-voiced women to wail for a decent number of days. \[...\] ‘It is rather strange that, with our constitutional love of business and division of labour, we have not adopted this custom, or improved upon it by constructing ingenious mechanics mourners operated by steam.’”

#### *Notes taken from BOTTOM OF GAMESCRIPT DOCUMENT* 

- Failing a skill check triggers autosave to restrict save-scummers. The skill points are based on your actual actions, so the game doesn’t baby-sit you through making the character you want. Instead, you turn out based on your choices. There’s no skill-point selection. Even when you fail, a message shows, saying you’ll be better at lockpicking next time.  
- In the [East End Docklands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th-century_London), the "gin-problem" was never taken care of. Sort of like in the US there are gang injunctions and unfair, biased policing in certain cities, the 'billy-clubbers' (militarized govt. police) will go and raid the 'ghetto' areas, which are still under prohibition. A War on Drugs making the situation worse.  
- The Dockhounds are running the show… similar to the Kray twins (Ronnie and Reggie), who had the Firm protection and extortion ring for many years until the murder in the Blind Beggar in Whitechapel. Ronnie was still committed to Broadmoor hospital when he died. **For our Don of the Dockhounds, AKA Kingpin, he too will be a paranoid schizo, making him incredibly unpredictable and frightening.**   
- Sorris Square has a tunnel to the Underground locomotive-tunnels and the catacombs (maybe). Detail the statue and other interactables. The Chinese laundry is there, where Atticus meets Bixby’s wife in her Chinese laundry. He’s had his clothes ripped in a fight, or else needs a costume for one of the missions, and has to go there for tailoring.  
- Atticus’s gambling debt is extra motivation and backstory, but the story is primarily about him coming to terms with his upbringing and his mother and recovering from the consequences of his vices. He also wants the cadre of magical-born minotaurs in the world to accept him, once he discovers their community by way of a macguffin—the Magical Sceptre, which is not an actual item the player can ever possess.  
- A mission (for Clara?) in the London Underground, hinting at how labyrinthine, sunless and lonely the tunnels can be…’ The cult moves about in the tunnels.  
- The Masked Stranger pulls the team together for his own ends, as well as potential altruism as far as going up against ‘the Cult,’ maybe called ‘The Organ Grinders,’ who abduct orphans and prostitutes for their organ-harvesting and sacrificial ceremonies. The Stranger also leads of the Greatcoats, a secret society of magicians who never show their faces and work magic in the shadows, which in their opinion is the only way to work against the capitalist, secular regime amassing political power by the end of the prequels, beginning *Sovereign Syndicate* (the full game), where you end up facing the Cult Leader, who isn't evil so much as a victim of his upbringing and circumstance that perverted his world view.

Opening idea \- had it 8-30-20, 9pm \- Converted to another doc on 8-31  
A dark shape looms over you, swimming in and out of focus. If you didn’t hear a voice from the shadow above you, you couldn’t even be sure it was alive, or just a representation of the dark cloud of your week-long bender at rock bottom. Just a dark cloud covering the oily *gas-lanterns* flickering along the brick walls of this alleyway where you must have picked for a place to die. But the dark shape does have a voice. It speaks to you.  
	This ends up being a ‘mysterious figure,’ who convinces you to step into the opium den with him, after waking you up with a Victorian-era street-stimulant smelling-salt. You ask why he’s buying you a pillow and a pipe-sit, and he says he wants to help you.  
“If you really want to help me,” you say, “you’ll make that a triple dose and let me die the peaceful death of dreams.”   
He gives you a choice, to take the lethal dose, or to help him out, for which he offers to connect you with your mother. You’re hoping that she, too is/was a Minotaur, or at least your father was, and she can help you find him. Minotaurs are very rare.   
You can’t take him seriously, until he starts spouting off about the orphanage you came from and how he knows where she ended up.   
“How could you…?”  
“I’m very well-connected. Nothing gets by me, unless it’s for my own good.”  
Then if you take the death-dose, you end up at the Start Menu.  
If you take the Dark Stranger’s offer, you fall into an opium dream where the conversation reminds you of being a kid in the orphanage, and learning how to use your magic powers with the help of a kind nun who takes pity on you, so that you can hide your Minotaur nature and get bullied a lot less. Even so, you steal money from the lockbox and run away when you’re fifteen years old, which is fully grown and developed for a Minotaur, at least physically, although not as far as magical powers and training.   
You wake up having detoxed from the hangover via the opium, but there’s something funny about this opium come-down. You don’t have the urge to fill the void with another vice, like a few shots of gin. For some reason you seem to have a kind of resigned clarity you can’t remember having in a long time. There seems to be only the task ahead of you, to follow the mission orders from the Stranger in the Hooded Greatcoat.   
(There aren’t many Minotaurs who can do magic anymore, as the magical bloodlines have died off, for a reason which we will find out in the end of the story--it has to do with society not accepting them, and them needing to grow up in isolation to develop their abilities, much like our orphan did, and much like the one in the Labyrinth would have in the Greek Legend.)  
Because there aren’t many, the Stranger wants to groom you into a powerful Minotaur Mage, so as to unlock this hidden treasure of a magical sceptre with Midas-like powers of turning things into pure gold. He thinks the sceptre is buried in a Minotaur-access only vault inside an underground cult of Minotaur magicians, who have a hideout in the catacombs beneath Paris, and that they themselves don’t even know that the sceptre is there, for the person who once had it, hid it very well because they knew people would fight bloody, greedy wars to possess it. Too dangerous for anyone to own, so this Ancient Minotaur tried to hide it forever.   
Perhaps we find out that the Stranger himself is a Minotaur, but only half, or had one in his family bloodline, but anyway, no matter his race, the Stranger will test our Minotaur main character with at least one mission in the London Underground, hinting at how 'labyrinthine, sunless and lonely the tunnels can be…’ which is a little spot of foreshadowing, but not super obvious.

Notes to consult for the orphanage flashback  
Netrem is a Clawdite, which makes him a changeling, or shapeshifter. Clawdites developed the ability to modify their skin color and body shape as a means to survival, after a spike in solar radiation beset the planet of Zolan, long ago while the species was evolving. Netrem was therefore blessed with a genetic resilience to disease. When his immune system encountered a virus or bacterial infection, it’d change as needed to fight it. Despite being a strong, healthy child, Netrem’s early years were no picnic. Due to his Clawdite nature, by age six the other children had taken to calling him “filthy beast,” refusing to sit near him, share food with him or invite him to play. Although the Tepani Sector wasn’t anti-alien per se, human businesses throughout the expanse provided their most lucrative opportunities to fellow Humans, and the wealth and opportunities trickled down through the noble houses and families, which consisted of solely human members.   
Netrem was physically bullied as well, often to the point of cuts and bruises that would come close to healing completely, only to be opened again by a troublesome orphan, who wasn’t provided an outlet for his disgruntled self-reflection of his own neglect. Seeing Netrem’s innocence being wrung out of him by these cruel, abandoned children broke nurse Paytela Bellbri’s heart.   
*\- Paytela’s Pursuit \-*   
Paytela was one of Netrem’s primary caregivers at the orphanage, and although she looked after others, she took a special liking to him, and helped him to perceive his changeling ability as a gift. It was only around Paytela that young Netrem was comfortable enough to fully experiment with his shapeshifting abilities. Later in life, it would take great concentration as well as loose, comfortable clothing for Netrem to change bodily form, but as a child, the weight of the world and his place in it had yet to reveal itself to Netrem. Without many friends at Light of the Vale, he spent his alone time in the safety of his favorite hiding spots. Once quite sure he was hidden, he would quiet his mind and focus deeply, the way children naturally can when they put their mind to it, and watch his fingers and toes turn into paws, fins or talons.  
By the time he was seven years old, Netrem began performing for Paytela in earnest, even hiding in her closet in the form of a tooka-cat and jumping out to scare her. Although Paytela started being able to predict when Netrem was in the closet, his playful leap towards her still sent her into jovial fits of laughter every time. Netrem as a striped tooka-cat was her favorite form he had mastered, since he reminded her of the loth-cat her family had kept around the house to control the population of loth-rats. Paytela’s family had emigrated from Lothal in the Outer Rim when she was seventeen.   
Although Paytela admired his abilities and positive outlook in the face of the other children’s prejudice, her pity for young Netrem outweighed such feelings. She knew once he emerged out of childhood and into adolescence, his ability to rise above the torment of the other children would falter, and she worried he would begin to lash out, as boys at such an age without loving role models are often known to do.  
Paytela spent many sleepless nights racking her brain for a wealthy family of nobles who might take Netrem in as a serving-boy. The most available choice was of course House Pelagia. Ladies and lords from the other noble families in the Tapani sector passed through Pelegar on business, but they’d be hard-pressed to stop at orphanage, much less adopt a young humanoid into their family. Besides, House Pelagia was the least xenophobic and most open-minded house, owing to a history of force-sensitive human members.  
It pained her dearly to imagine Netrem coming of age in the orphanage, growing older and older than the rest of the children, and eventually having more in common with the staff than the orphans under her care. As Paytela tended to the cuts and bruises Netrem would receive in his scuffles with the other boys, she couldn’t help but imagine him growing up to be a great soldier. Perhaps it was his stubborn resilience. As Netrem’s intelligence grew, Paytela noticed him coming up with clever ways to avoid the boys who tormented him. She hoped to come upon someone from House Pelagia with a tradition of raising up capable men into the military service. She could think of several military-minded noblemen who had served in the House Pelagia Airborne, a venerable affiliate and ally to the Tapani Sector Defense Force.  
*\- A Chance Encounter \-*   
One day Paytela was buying Jogan fruit at the market and ran into an old friend from primary school, Savamir Pellagra. Paytela immediately noticed Savamir had a governess doing the physical act of picking up, paying and putting the fruit in baskets for her. Savamir only made her selections and waited politely as her governess attended to her requests.   
As Paytela and Savamir were both between errands, they decided to stop for a caffa and catch up. Paytela noticed a wedding band as they chatted. Paytela congratulated her old friend and asked to whom she was married. Savamir told her his name was Tiersen, but didn’t reveal his last name. Paytela knew better than to press a noblewoman for information, especially being the commoner she was. To Paytela’s surprise and rekindled hope, Savamir told her it was a happy marriage, but that she and her husband had been having trouble conceiving.  
“To be perfectly honest,” Savamir said, “When you mentioned your work at the orphanage, I meant to inquire upon the process of adoption. Those poor, unfortunate children…”  
“Well,” Paytela said soberly. “It’s true that our resources have spread quite thin in the last few years, but we do our best to go above and beyond the call of duty to give the children a chance at adoption. That is the end goal for every last one of them.” Paytela bit her lip, carefully considering the best way to go on. “But the process is rather simple. We try to make it so.”  
They decided to meet again the following week, and after this meeting Paytela convinced Savamir to visit, assuming her husband did not object. Paytela’s heart swelled with anticipation for the day of Savamir’s visit. Paytela wondered if Savamir would feel a similar, raw pity for young Netrem who was now nearly nine years old and a wellspring of potential. By this point Netrem was far ahead of the other children his age, not only physically, but emotionally and intellectually as well.  
On the scheduled day of her visit, Savamir surprised Paytela by arriving along with her husband, Tiersen Pursal. Tiersen was a Baron, and Savamir a Baroness, although she’d been entirely tolerant to Paytela’s informal yet acceptable use of ‘my lady’ over the course of their re-connection. Paytela was taken aback, as she hadn’t prepared Netrem to meet his potential father as well. Paytela of course knew who Tiersen Pursal was. He ran a lucrative armony that supplied weapons and laser cannons to House Pelagia gunships. She smiled broadly and welcomed the couple, hoping she would have a chance to ask Savamir why she had been so careful not to reveal her husband’s identity, especially since it made her a Baroness.

### 

### **Outtakes \-** 

#### *Atticus Awakens — First Draft and following Iterations*

###### **DEATH SCREEN:** 

- An obituary in the penny papers lays in a rain-puddle, sodden and scarcely legible, save for these lines: Minotaur Body Found, No Known Relatives. Funeral Service held by the Sacred Heart \- Alms Accepted.

###### **ALLEY:**

- ALTERNATE INTRO \- A shadow looms over you, swimming in and out of focus. You can’t be sure if the shape is alive or an illusion. A spectral manifestation of the gin-bender you might have just survived. Is it death? In any case, it isn’t keen on leaving you alone.   
- But at least it blocks the light of the carbide lamps, their flicker-flames needling your eyes and causing headaches. As the shadow moves, an awareness is forced in, spiking painful memories in your addled brain, recalling this place, where you’d meant to drink away your days. A cold alleyway in the East End. So if this isn’t the harbinger of death, then even at suicide you’ve failed.

- Atticus: Gee thanks for the warning… You always put a nice spin on things, don’t you?  
- …Animal Instinct: What's it to you, Old Crone?  
- Many a {mingebag} have come to collect. This {barmy} {naff} is no different.   
- *Dialogue Option (1) \- Why should it surprise you…?* Atticus Daley: Why should it surprise you when you said it yourself? With the company I keep, I’ll  pay my debts with my life soon enough. That’s how it is around here…  
    
  **Locked Gate \-**  
- On closer inspection, you notice by the make and model that it’s a dimpled lock; easy to crack open.  
- {Brigands} and maniacs, that’s to be sure. Not to mention {cane rats} the size of Centaurs.  
- Animal Instinct: Or worse, an actual Centaur.

  **Herring Basket \-** 

  (Fade to Black. Fade back to the Alley, but with a Cloud of Stench around the Herring Basket: impassible until the next time the Player enters the Level. The Minotaur Model is now laid flat on the cobbles. Cue animation of Minotaur standing up) — Cut for lack of animation

  **Containment Fence \-**

- The electricity keens up your arms and carousels down your legs, petering out in the cobbles at your feet.  
- Electricity keens up your arms, carouseling down your legs and petering out in the cobbles.  
- The shock singes the hair on your hands, carouseling through you and exiting in the cobbles.  
- **The shock singes the hair on your hands, carouseling down your legs and petering out in the cobbles.**  
-   
- *British East India Company, not the Dutch West India company which ended earlier*  
- You turn away with a grunt, stretching your aching limbs, and hoping your slight fear hasn’t been seen or smelled.  
- Old Crone: Like something on display in an East India Trade Company window.  
- GLOSSARY: A powerful shipping company of commodities from India, with ruling power on the continent and storefronts in the London Docklands  
-   
- —surely another one of the {Don}’s lackeys.   
-   
- Wicker Basket: With a simple, curved handle, this basket is well-made.   
-   
- …Wit: He won't be swayed…   
-   
- Just then you notice a second, blurry shape—small and white and catching the lamplight. A glass bottle comes into focus, capped with a moulded crown of unpolished pewter. Long, shadowy fingers begin unscrewing the cap. The squeaking it makes is a nail bomb in your cranium. The pain is so bad you almost pass out again, but then a scent burns in your nostrils—smelling salts. Like an electric coil of copper-wire down your spine, you sit up with a jolt and bite down on your tongue. The shock of the burning in your nose is impossible to ignore, and you swipe out at the bottle which brought you from your stupor.  
- The bottle disappears in the dark shape above it, the same shadowy fingers pulling it back. Your double-vision fading, you could just make out the text on the bottle before it was gone. ‘Bull’s Head,’ the label had read, with the vigorous, smiling image of a bull. Ironic, you think to yourself, you—a strung-out Minotaur—having his head shaken loose from a gin-bender, by way of the Bull’s Head Brand. With the bottle tucked away in the folds of broad shadow, you start to be able to hear a voice as well. A voice which comes from the dark shape above you.

...which has not only chewed you to rock-bottom, but taken out heavy chunks of your heart, and perhaps your soul.

- And later….   
  As the stranger drags you along, you give up the last of your  hope. You were ready to die anyway, so maybe this is simply your executioner’s arrival and escort.  
- Later still…   
  The scrolled sections of mask move along with the stranger’s face, shifting and sliding on the planes of his cheeks, with spiked chains interlocked at his jawline.  
- ...the knuckles of which are spiked with steel tips.

- The sudden motion has sent your head reeling, and a rail-spike of a headache shatters through your cranium. Clamping your teeth, you stand up with every ounce of strength. 

- Atticus Daley: Hold on, have we ever spoken like this before?  
- Old Crone: From time to time, when you’re coherent enough and not trying to escape me with one of your vices.   
- Dialogue Options  
- Dialogue Option: All the more reason to quit drinking...  
- Option Result:   
- Old Crone: Come now, we must set realistic goals. Start by cutting back, not quitting altogether. If you did that, you’d fall off the wagon so hard you might kill yourself. And if that should happen… I’ll have to move on to someone else.  
- Dialogue Option: I can’t go on living like this.  
- Option Result:   
- Atticus: What’s the use of life without the peace and quiet of my own mind? If I can’t get you out of my head, let’s run this iron horse into the blue oblivion\!  
- Old Crone: Do as you please… And if you do kill yourself, I’ll just move onto someone else.  
- \- Both results feed into Atticus’s following line \-   
- Atticus: Nice try. If I die, you’re coming with me.   
- Crone: You know nothing.  
- Atticus: Oh, piss off. I need to collect my things. 

- Atticus Daley: That’s enough out of you, you old crone\!  
- Old Crone: As good a name as any.

(after looking at Orphanage poster)

- Atticus: It would be hard not to, but try as I might I can’t seem to forget.    
- Old Crone: Come now, you must have some fond memories?   
- Atticus: Heloise was always kind, but I remember you being in and out of my head quite a lot…   
- Old Crone: You must know that absence wasn’t by choice, I’d have been with you if I could.The powers that be were keeping me distant…   
- Atticus: I managed just fine on my own.   
- Old Crone: Aye, perhaps for a time…   
- Atticus: Well, I suppose those years were hard on us both.  
- Old Crone: And it hasn’t gotten easier…


- Atticus Daley: Besides, breaking the lock would be too loud, someone might notice. In any case, it looks like it would only lead to some rotten stable or storeroom—another dead end.

- Atticus Daley: Haven’t I suffered enough for one life?  
- Old Crone: I’ve known you a long time, Atticus. You underestimate the amount of suffering you can handle.

- Old Crone: You head down the alleyway, with a stubborn yet flimsy hope of escape.  
- Atticus: Is dying the only way to get you to stop narrating?   
- Old Crone: Death erases consciousness—so yes.   
- Atticus: Alright then, you’re not going anywhere until I keel over. Bringing us back to square one. We talk about this a lot, huh?  
- Old Crone: …   
- Atticus: I’ll take that as a yes. 

- Atticus: Thanks for getting my up off the street. Not that I couldn’t have slept longer…

- Cut from 1st fight sequence \-   
  \-**Old Crone:** Without the strength or will to resist you resign yourself to your inevitable fate. Whatever the stranger has in store for you, you’ll find out soon enough.  
  \-**Old Crone:** Well that didn’t go well did it? Seems to be more to this stranger than meets the eye.  
  \-**Stranger:** Glad we understand each other, come on then, off we go.  
  \-**Atticus:** Wait, where are you taking me? What's this all about?  
  \-**Old Crone:** You get no response from the stranger, just laboured grunting as he pulls you along.  
  \-**Old Crone:** Stepping on the stranger's boot you grab hold of his wrist with your free hand. But in your weakened, hungover state, the strength seems  to melt from your fingers.  
  *But he locks onto your wrist and twists your hand away.*  
  *\-***Stranger:** You can’t shrug off your duty that easily, this is too important.  
  \-**Old Crone:** The stranger is glaring at you  with an icy, glittering look. His grey eyes brighten until they’re two points of burning white.  
  \-**Atticus:** What in the world?  
  \-**Old Crone:** Whatever thoughts were crossing your mind are frozen in place. Like watching a busy intersection warp into slow motion and then hold entirely still. *(This node contained the Rictus Curse before)*  
  \-**Old Crone:** You can’t even think about what it means to think. All you can perceive is the stranger’s thin lips muttering under the mask, casting a rictus curse. Stone-cold in the thrall of the spell, you have no strength or initiative to resist.  
  \-**Old Crone:** Suddenly the spell is broken as the stranger smacks you across the face with the back of his brass-ratcheted glove. As the blood runs from your nose and the ringing in your ears obscures all other sounds, you notice the stranger draw his weapon—a cutlass-pistol. The steel blade glints in light from the gas-lamps, and when he cocks the hammer, the rest of the fight leaves you.  
  \-**Atticus:** Wait\! I’ll come along willingly. Even with a death-wish, I still don’t want a painful one.  
  \-**Old Crone:** In the wake of your failures, you’ve no choice but to go along unwillingly, hanging your head submissively like a death-row prisoner resigned to his fate. Your only wish, the comfort of a long gin-slumber, a place you can go to sleep and never know you passed away.  
  **…**  
  \-The tumble has flipped your stomach, and induces a bout of dry-retching. Nothing comes up but a few caustic drops of gin. When the nausea fades…  
  \-The steel blade glints in light from the gas-lamps, and when he cocks the hammer, the rest of the fight leaves you.   
  \-The stranger spins you around with a twisting grip on your arm, and forces you along, with the cutlass blade at your back.   
  Old Crone: He swiftly reverses the hold on your own wrist, twisting your arm behind your back and pushing you forward. The forced momentum causes you to stumble, and something heavy hits your back before you can get your footing.   
  Atticus Daley: ?  
  Old Crone: Stumbling face-first into the cold, cobbled ground, you bite down on your tongue, filling your mouth with the taste of hot copper.   
  Masked Stranger: ?  
  Old Crone: a steel-toe boot collides with your ribcage. You roll over, groaning and wishing you hadn’t tried any funny business. The stranger then yanks you up by your overcoat-collar.  
  \-Fight back—    
  Atticus: Get off me\!   
  Old Crone: You shout through your piercing headache, trying your best to shrug him off.   
  Old Crone: You try to punch the stranger and he ducks the blow easily, then glares with an icy, glittering look. His grey eyes brighten until they’re two points of burning white, and whatever thoughts were crossing your mind are frozen in place. Like watching a busy intersection warp into slow motion and then hold entirely still.   
  Old Crone: You cannot even think about what it means to think. All you can perceive is the stranger’s thin lips muttering under the mask, casting a rictus curse. Stone-cold in the thrall of the spell, you have no strength or initiative to resist.   
  Old Crone: Suddenly the spell is broken as the stranger smacks you across the face with the back of his brass-ratcheted glove, the knuckles of which are spiked with steel tips. As the blood runs from your nose and the ringing in your ears obscures all other sounds, you notice the stranger drawing his weapon—a cutlass-pistol.   
  Old Crone: The steel blade glints in light from the gas-lamps, and when he cocks the hammer, the rest of the fight leaves you. Even with your death-wish, you still don’t want a painful one. The stranger spins you around with a twisting grip on your arm, and forces you along, with the cutlass blade at your back.  (-10 Vigour)  
    
- Old Crone: You should be ashamed of  how weak you’ve become. Once such a strong, powerful Minotaur, able to strike fear in any back-alley. Now you’ve been overpowered by someone half your size. You’re a hollow husk of the man you could be.   
  Atticus Daley: I blame my present condition…   
  Old Crone: Oh yes, your vices are withering your spirit. But there is still hope of a life without them. However, if you allow the self-loathing to complete, then death may seem the only option.  
  Atticus Daley: Feels like I’ve heard this spiel from you before…  (-10 Nerve)

- Cut from red Lantern Lane \-   
  ~~...a red-brick alleyway with pools of piss, blood and rotting slime — breeding ground for roaches. Half-melted trash bins hulk in the shadows, caracasses from so many cold vagrants in need of fire. Flies buzz at the matted fur of a rat-poisoned badger, and massive, toothy mice scurry along the windowsills. Vampire-bats hang from oxidised drain-pipes. A stewbum lays in a fresh pool of vomit, his leg twitching slightly, alive in his own nightmare.~~ \[USED\]  
  “Must be what I looked like before he woke me up,” you think to yourself as the stranger whips you around the corner. Next moment…  
  ...Barely able to hold your gaze on anything more than a second, the stranger rushes you along the sloping macadam street. ~~Rounding a curve, the flames in the carbide lamps begin switching. Guttering green-yellow turning to orangey red. The rooftops lean in toward each other like dominoes.~~  \[USED\]  
  ...It’s red-tinted box is made of stippled glass, leaded on each corner with gold-flake alloy. You look up at its flickering flame with a smile.

###### **SORRIS SQUARE:**

**Sorris Square Subtext and Exposition Notes:** 

- We aren't sure if it's really a possessed statue, or if Poe is throwing his voice like a ventriloquist. We see the statue's portrait during this section of Dialog.

**Cut from the description of road-paving, etc:**

- The Big Smoke, otherwise known as London-town, is run by Crown and the upper crust of elite industrialists with economic sway,  
- Rooks (an alternate name for the Dockhounds/a rival gang) was taken out

**Older initial description in full:**

- At the Western edge of the East End, the mediaeval cobbles have all been flattened to dust. Even in Spitalfields and as far as Flower and Dean, the streets are smoothed over with a black bile of macadam. The work is done by the chaw-spitting navvies, mostly of humans and dwarf blood, eyes gleefully spiteful in the grips of a daily gin-craze. Fribbles and ninnies now glide upon pavement, in steam-powered, gilded cabriolets. And it makes no difference to the navvies that they might erase history—they’ll toil for any steady pay.   
  Yet preservation is alive in the Docklands. From Whitechapel to Cable, Parliamentary clauses have been grandfathered in, prohibiting the foundation of Lordships, whose sway will deliver the right building permits to the tar-tycoons in the rest of Her Majesty’s London. But here in the Docklands the Bosses are in charge, and the average popinjay avoids the area, for fear of ransom or robbery by the Dockhounds. Nobles with common sense hardly cross the River Lea, and anything East of Aldgate is a rare place for gentry. The Lordships and Ladyships who chance it in the East End must have an ear to the cobbles and old ways. They know the loopholes, willing to skim extra tin by a bribe to the right crime Bosses. Noble or not, anyone down in the Docklands on business is bound for a stop in Sorris Square—the apex of the informal economy.

###### **INFERNO:**

**Loading Text**  
A nondescript door at the end of the bar leads down the basement. The stairs are undecorated, with a mildewed mop askew in the corner, beside a copper bucket, as if to suggest the passage is only for utility access. But you know better, and a world of wager and chance awaits you at the bottom of the thinly carpeted steps. Adorning the mouldering stone walls, bare carbide lamps glare in smoky patterns, leading into the fiery pit of your vices.  
	After a knock at the door, a peephole slides open, and after checking his list of members, he opens the door. Inside it is filled with thick cheroot cigar smoke, and low-burning lanterns line the walls with embroidery-panels between the beams. The ceiling is low and stippled with brass, monogrammed with the crest of the Dockhounds, the local gang running the show here. Claret and gin flows freely. Chips clatter in and out of pewter bank trays, underscored by a murmur of velveteen voices. Now and then there’s a grumble or a chuckle of delight, depending on who’s up, and who’s down to the felt.  
	Men drift about in bespoke gambling coats, with low-brimmed hats covering eyes that might reveal their hands. Many have pulled back their lace cuffs and wrapped leather guards around them to protect their fine garments as they reach across the scuffed velvet for chips. Games of every kind in this Golden Hall—hidden well enough for even Lordships who brave the East End to risk their fortunes discreetly. Parlour-games from piquet to faro, from casino to ombre and quadrille, not to mention the betting book, where anything imaginable—from a bachelor’s choice of whom to marry, to the number of stray dogs crossing Cable street over an afternoon—can be bet upon.

- The Floorman (also the Don’s Lackey — known only in the parlour by a nametag showing — “Mister K.” AKA John Kirby) shows up, offering VIP treatment at Clara’s show, his motivation being that you don’t win more money off the House, b/c he sees your good string of luck.  
- The Player can decide whether this is due to an attraction to Clara, or trying to turn the luck towards himself at the expense of others. Crone/Atticus decide that it’s better to play it cool and not call Clara out. The Crone gives advice as always, while Atticus is influenced by a subconscious attraction to Clara.  
- Clara takes a liking to you more so than George or Sydney; but Persuasion is still needed. She becomes (ostensibly) a good luck charm, but whether she was a Cooler or not, the Baccarat players have already won enough beforehand to walk away happily.   
    
  **CHESTER MARTIN REMOVED**  
- SPR. A stout fellow with the look of a seaman is blowing on the dice, getting ready to roll, but when I sit down, he cuts his eyes sharply in my direction.  
- (Hearty Gambler) TIM. Another player, ay? I liked the table as it was.  
- (Kind Gambler) CHE. Aww, don’t be like that. This Parlour is open to all and besides, what’s the use of an empty chair? Now then, my name is Chester Martin. I work as a chimney sweep all through the East End, then I dump most of my wages into this money pit. Anyway, there’s no sense in griping. I can stop when I want to.   
- TIM. He just doesn’t want to.  
- CHE. Maybe that’s fair enough. Say now, what’s the new player’s name?  
- SPR. Lad’s a {sweep} alright. Fellow could use a wash. Anyroad, no point lying. The staff know you here.  
- WIT. Martin has oily black streaks behind his ears and on his neck. Must’ve been in a rush. Anyway, there’s no point in giving a false name—the croupiers and pit bosses all know you here.   
- PC. Name’s Atticus Daley. Pleasure to meet you. And your friend here?  
- TIM. If Chester is willing to get acquainted, so am I. Name’s Timothy Agarwal, but Timothy is fine. Now then, let’s stopper the chitchat and cast.   
- CHE. If only you knew when to stopper the whisky bottle.  
- TIM. There’s no fault to be found there—I married an Irish lass, so maybe her habits rubbed off on me. Anyway, I function much better with a little fire in my belly.  
- CHE. Let’s hope the dice don’t disagree.  
- (cont’d)  
- HAZ. {Caster}? What’ll it be?  
- TIM. I’ll take seven.  
- HAZ. Caster has seven, place your special bets. Ready?  
- SR. The croupier wears a brown vest with shiny brass buttons. His skin is the shade of a tallow candle, like a wax figure. Surely he’s been in this basement far too long.  
- SPR. The croupier obsessively licks his fingers before collecting chips from the players and straightening the stacks, sliding them to their destinations within the coloured squares on the felted table.  
- (Betting Interface — Player chooses a CurrencyAmount to wager)  
- (cont’d)  
- INS. Timothy’s face is flushed from a morning of wine-bibbing, and his grease-curled black hair is a filigree around his fretful face. He throws in\!  
- SR. Timothy wears a tailored, split-tailed, brushed velvet waistcoat, the brass buttons long since green with oxidisation. A sash-loop dangles free of its piping, and the paisley lapels are frayed to the innermost fibres. Surely it’s secondhand, only purchased so as to gain entrance.   
- CHE. Hurry now, throw in while the dice are hot\!

Pumphouse Captain: Ehh, I don’t have time to argue\! And I don’t imagine you’d throw much of a wrench into anything. But if I were you, I’d get back street-side. It gets rather nasty down here in the wee ticks.

2a2 \- Animal Instinct… Atticus Daley: It’s clear enough what’s going on. You could’ve had a friend in me, but instead you’ve made an enemy.   
Pumphouse Captain: Even if we were the last to survive a catastrophe, I still wouldn’t take you for a {goodfellow}\! And if I catch you meddling, I’ll take one of your hands for a souvenir.  
Spryness: His pike-spade shimmers in the torchlight. Looks freshly sharpened…  
 Sub-options (2a2a & 2a2b) \-   
2a2a \- Animal Instinct… Atticus Daley: I’ve a blade of my own that’s a worthy executioner.

Pumphouse Captain: I don’t imbibe myself, but with \<b\>these\</b\> wages, they must do a {roaring trade}.

Pumphouse Captain: I know it’s queer, but the gaskets in the pumphouse are being cleaned and replaced. I’m guarding the entrance to be sure there’s no interference in the process.  
Wit: He’s been ousted from his duties…

Pumphouse Captain: Well… yes. But I’ve got a mind to keep my job\! If someone goes tampering while I’m gone, then I might not have a pumphouse to captain, would I?  
Wit: You’d think the higher-ups would hire some guards.  
Old Crone: But if he’s happy to do it, no sense ruffling feathers.

Self-Reflection: A gesture of genuine concern. He must’ve had friends of his own disappear…

Sub-option (2a1a2a) \- Self-Reflection… Atticus Daley: It’s not your job to keep secrets. You’re just supposed to manage the pumps.

*Random idea(s):* 

- Mr. Welcome — a nickname for Atticus, b/c he’s ‘Welcome anywhere.’ It’s from when he used to pay his debts, but now it’s used ironically, and the Ladsman can reveal this, now that he sees his face and recognizes him. Atticus doesn’t remember at first, and the Player can choose whether this is due to gin-bathing, or honest forgetfulness (+1 Composure)  
- *By completing the Interrogate McGrady Quest, the Ladsman is persuaded to reveal the details of the organ-shopping / snatching for Mr. Cline, but if pressed on this point, he will lash out, and only reveal details if Atticus promises to spare his life. Player chooses to keep that promise or not.*

  B \- Ladsman is wounded enough so that Cutpurse can finish the job with a stiletto to the Ladsman’s throat from behind, but she only does so if the Minotaur is low enough in Vigour (Wounded idle).  
  C \- Ladsman wins a majority of Skill Checks, resulting in Player Choice to either flee, in which case the Cutpurse flees and the Ladsman follows her, meaning SavedCutpurse is still false.

###### **THE BATHHOUSE:**

...Wit: Maybe they like positions from which they can proselytise. 

...Old Crone: The Bathhouse walls are lined with bamboo, and a huge Chinese lantern hangs in place of a chandelier. A steaming square tub sits in the centre of the floor, tiled with ambergris marble. Pots of incense burn down to yellow coals, wafting steam into a dream-like ethos. Wood panels on the back wall are carved with bucolic landscapes from the Far East; misty clouds in high mountains. One of the wood panels is cracked open slightly, and a red light slivers through. The hidden entrance to the opium den.

Opening \-   
…Old Crone: Despite the lingering body-aches and nausea, you do feel much better don’t you? Just the thought of that sweet opium release is enough to lift your spirits.  
*As close as I’ll ever be…* I’ve never been happy… but I’ve gotten close in this place.  
Journal Entry \- My favourite opium den could it be coincidence that the stranger has led me here?

Revamped Opening \-   
Alternate lines \- And remember when you were happy. No way to erase it. / And remember that time you said you were happy. It never has to fade.

Changing Area \-   
Concentrate now, Atticus, you can do this.  
Never seen that bouncer at the back bar before. Better look Human, in case he gets his knickers in a twist **when he sees a Minotaur.**  
Holding this form takes all my concentration, best save my wits for defending myself if it comes to that.  
Alt \- Sight from the fire, hearing from ether, smell from the air and taste from the water... Focus your senses and touch down to the earth in another form.

Mahogany Bar \-   
…A brass-linteled, mahogany bar sits before the back wall, with a Centaur bouncer behind it, wearing a drowsy look and resting his chin in his hands. Candles gutter on the scrub-top bar, casting eerie shadows on his weary face. Judging by the cloying scent of mange, his burly lower-half must be in poor shape as well. You can smell the equine muck-sweat even through the haze of incense.  
Why did it have to be a Centaur?  
Centaurs are a detestable bunch, most of them at least. They always seem to get a rush from a power trip; any position from which they can proselytise. Except for the owner of the Red Lotus, Bixby Browncoat. Mr. Browncoat is oft-times waiting at the bar with a casual smile, but not tonight.  
1 \- Maybe if I wait around long enough Bixby will show up?  
2 \- Better to appear human in situations like these. No need to cause a scene and I'm in no mood to fight.  
3 \- Fortune favours the bold; better get on with it.

Bouncer \-   
…Askew on the Centaur’s head is a bowler hat, banded with imitation-silk. He straightens up and leers at you with beady, black eyes, misshapen chin jutting out below his jangle of buck-teeth. Beneath a crimson vest, his bare chest is stricken with advanced psoriasis. The scaly rash covers his pock-marked cheeks as well.  
The smelly Centaur glares directly at you without a word. Before you can break in, the stranger steps forward, foreseeing the impending row.  
Hail and well met. Fine spot of the weather, eh?  
Somefin’ the matter? the Centaur asks, plainly addressing you, not the stranger.  
…The stranger tries to cut in but the damage is done. ‘Heifer’ is one of the worst slurs for a Minotaur.  
…I don’t think it’s the incense I’m smelling. I think it’s the horse-shit spilling from your fat, manky mouth. So you better shut it before it gets swelled shut.  
…You brandish your sword stick **with a white-knuckle grasp on the handle**. / You prepare to draw your blade with a white-knuckle grasp…  
…That’ll get you inside… As for the sirloin… Policy is policy.  
…I’d like a word with the owner, please. We happen to be on a  
first-name basis.  
…The Centaur whinnies indecisively. You slap an impatient palm on  
 the bartop.

…Got nothing to do with what I has to say. It’s just we has a policy ‘gainst filthy, ruddy cow-pies. Boss ain’t havin’ no more fightin’ in the den. Your lot’s always bringin’ it around. Bulls in a China shop… Not good for business.

…Well, perhaps so. Needless to say, I haven't a slim notion of why I should delay you any further\! Go right ahead, then. And sorry for the wait.

…ALT. Stricken with psoriasis, the scaly rash reddens his chest and pock-marked cheeks.

…I slap a hand on the bartop, and the Centaur flares his nostrils in contempt, sweeping his waistcoat to reveal a long dagger.  
…Who does this ruffian think he is? Whatever my next move, I'd better be swift about it.

…Seemingly on cue the wood panel behind the bar swings open, and out trots Bixby Browncoat. No doubt, come to see what all the fuss is about.  
…Seemingly on cue, the wood panel behind the bar swings open, and to the stranger's relief, it’s Bixby. No doubt to come see what all the noise is about.  
…Bixby Browncoat, the owner proprietor of the Red Lotus appears. He has a distinguished, long-faced countenance, sporting a gold pocket watch and a lavender-tinted pince-nez with octagonal frames, settled low on his aquiline nose. Despite his refined style and careful preening, the turbulence of a life lived in the margins shows on his face, with a river-delta of wrinkles. He peers over his pince-nez with his deep-set eyes, the same sienna-brown as his coat of fur.  
ALT \- Old Crone: It’s Bixby Browncoat, the owner  proprietor of the Red Lotus.   
Perception: With a long-faced countenance, he sports a pocketwatch and a pince-nez with lavender lenses. The octagonal frames sit low on his beaky nose.

...Like riding a velocipede. A mage never forgets his tricks. Now enough tomfoolery. Let’s get inside and get sublime.  
...and his throat moves drily as he mulls over the possibility.  
...You wink at the stranger knowingly. There’s no such thing as an opium contact-high.  
...Old Crone: The bouncer presses a button below the bar and with a churning of gears, the wood panel that was slightly ajar swings open.  
...Clearly his favourite feature, his lustrous mane is carefully braided and draped over his right shoulder, shines like a shampoo commercial. He strokes it absently.   
...Bixby Browncoat: Not the sort of bottlenecking I expect from my doorman\!  
Bouncer: But Mr. Browncoat\! You don’t see? This cow-pie is vying for entrance\!  
...Old Crone: Before you can respond, the words stick in your throat. The stranger  
is fixing you with an eldritch stare. Damn… another one of his under-the-breath  
incantations. Sorry, can’t help you here. Without taking his gaze off you, the  
stranger whaps down a twenty-pound note.  
Masked Stranger: This should account for a moment of the owner’s time.  
Old Crone: Turning to the stranger, the Centaur’s eyes deaden slightly, and his  
shoulders deflate. The stranger could very well be cursing him, too.  
...“Well, erm… sorry mates. I know it’s getting down to the nitty gritty, but believe it or not, I forgot something of mine in the changing area. Allow me… so sorry…”  
...Old Crone: Drawling with bigotry, he hones his piggy eyes on you.  
...Old Crone: You’re trying not to seem as confused as you are. Could they really have stopped letting Minotaurs in? Usually you’re welcomed with open arms. With all the tin you’ve sloughed off in here over the years, you’re definitely a Priority Member. But the stranger steps between you and the Centaur, smacking down a twenty-pound note on the scrub-top.   
...Old Crone: The Centaur grunts his agreement, then fixes his eyes back on you. You step forward, level with the stranger at the desk, holding the Centaur’s gaze, but wrinkling your nose at the stench.   
...Old Crone: Lips chortling, Bixby clops over to the wood panel concealing the entrance. The commotion has obviously rattled him, his motormouth churning like a turbine  
...Bixby Browncoat: And who might this be? New friend, or business partner?”   
Atticus Daley:  
Well, that remains to be seen.  
He’s footing my bill… can’t complain.  
I don’t really do ‘friends.’  
Bixby Browncoat: Just so? Fantastic, spare me the details.   
Old Crone: Bixby’s goatee is bobbing with laughter.   
Bixby Browncoat: Never a nosy Nellie— not Mr. Browncoat\! (the masked stranger knows Bixby quite well, the chinese laundry and opium den / bath house being fronts for the syndicate HQ)

###### **OPIUM DEN:**

- **​​Automaton \-**   
  A clattering of gears grabs your attention. Spinning round, you nearly pitch over, having to stumble your cloven feet out of the way of a swerving automaton underfoot.   
  The mechanised creature is huffing along by way of an Arsenal Heartdrum steam-boiler. His chassis is a perfect sphere, with ball-jointed legs that broaden into conical, pressure-pad feet. His brass-capped head spins like a lighthouse lamp.  
  Sorry, didn’t see you there\!  
  What the—  
  The automaton is clicking and whirring along past you, coming to rest at the booth beside yours, where a plump, ginger-bearded dwarf is hunched over the table. He must be the rude robot’s master.  
  (GLOSSARY) \-  A design firm for advanced machinery  
    
- **Sunken Area \-**   
  It’s so late that \[ALT \- even the burnouts are gone. The hours before daybreak are…\]  
  \[...\]  
  The sunken floor-pit is dotted with satin pillows, each costing only a ha’penny. It’s a busy night. About half the pillows are taken. Those on the main floor are withered and weak-looking, all of them men. Sallow-cheeked blokes with beards down to their bellies and smoke-stained moustaches. They look so comatose, they might not be able to tell you their own name.  
  The main floor is usually all you can afford. As Bixby said, you’re quite welcome here, even in Minotaur form. Even so, a tuppence will only get you a half-bowl and a spot on the floor. With the shylocks always at your heels, tracking your every move in the East End, the most you can ever save up is a few pence.  
  \[...\] *If NPCs are added in*  
  Perception: Those on the main floor are withered and weak-looking. Sallow-cheeked blokes with beards to their bellies and smoke-yellowed skin.   
  Animal Instinct: They look comatose…   
  Self-Reflection: Might not be able to tell you their own name.   
  Old Crone: The main floor is usually all you can afford.   
  Self-Reflection: But Bixby said, you’re quite welcome here, even in natural form.

  SR. A {calabash pipe} waggles in his mouth when he chuckles, the embers dancing inside.

  ALT: The Dwarf has a broad nose and lucid blue eyes. His moustache is so full, you half-expect it to crawl off his face. Altogether, he gives off a cheerful demeanour.  
  ALT: The Dwarf has a broad nose and lucid blue eyes. His moustache is so full, you half-expect it to crawl off his face. Altogether, he gives off a cheerful demeanour. The dwarf has a warm and amiable look, with the sort of lucid blue eyes you can’t stay angry at.  
  ALT: His long beard is braided and ringed in the common style. You tug at your own goatee, suddenly aware how stringy it is. You finger the brass ring in your own goatee. It’s stringy and coarse compared to the dwarf’s elegant bristles.  
  \[...\]  
  {Struth}, but I’m fed up with all the tinkering. I much prefer drawing up designs. So that’s why I’m training up my ‘prentice, this bucket of brass\!  
  \[...\]  
  OLD: The dwarf has a warm and amiable look, with the sort of lucid blue eyes you can’t stay angry at. His gaze is so sharp and clearly intelligent, that you find yourself intrigued. Below his crystal-blue eyes is a broad nose and a red moustache. His beard is as red as a skinned rabbit, and braided and brass-ringed in the common style.  
  You finger the brass ring in your own goatee. It’s stringy and coarse compared to the dwarf’s long, elegant bristles. A calabash tobacco pipe waggles in his mouth when he chuckles, the embers dancing inside. The dwarf has a mechanised arm and leg on his left side, and by his steampowered backpack, you get the impression that his augmentations don’t stop there.  
  Some kind of inventor are you? That rickety thing just about ran me over.  
  Bless my beard, sorry about that\! Name’s Theodore. Theodore Redgrave, but most people just call me Teddy. This little bucket of brass here is Otto. Doesn’t care much for other people, but that’s in his programming. Can’t blame him, really.  
  Fair enough, Name’s Atticus Daley.  
  Pleasure, pleasure, to be sure.  
  The dwarf pats the automaton lightly with a fat paw.  
  I’ll need to make a few adjustments soon. Need this fellow fit as a fiddle for the upcoming brawls.  
  Brawls?  
  In the werewolf pits, my boy\! I’m a hunter of foul beast and monster, you see. And once the dust has settled, these ruddy outlaws are much easier to take into custody. Just three days ‘ere the moon is full-bellied\!  
  Ah yes, the pit fights. Never seen our little friend here fight but have attended my fair share, good for a wager or two.  
  Ah, a man of culture then. Now that I think of it, a stature such as yours could make for an opportune scuffle. Would you ever be interested in joining my docket? I could pay you handsomely, of course.  
  *I’ll think about it…* Not really my style but I could be convinced if the purse was right, a man’s gotta eat after all. I’ll think about it.  
  Well then, I’m pleased to be acquainted, and perhaps our paths will cross again.  
  Yes, Have a good night… and keep an eye on that contraption of yours…  
  \[...\]  
  ALT \- TED. Well I’m pleased to be acquainted then\! Here's hoping I'll see you again soon.  
    
  **Booth \-**   
  Alt (Newer): Private Booth: Behind these lattice wooden screens you can order exclusive items that only privacy can afford. The cushions here are lambskin, and a pot of jasmine tea has already been served. // \-or- served by a steward who waits for your signal.  
  Old Crone: You’re getting special treatment. Bixby must feel bad about his new bouncer. Or else he caught a whiff of the stranger’s pocketbook.   
  Animal Instinct: The {cove} reeks of {capital}\!   
  Wit: That’s true, and if he’s a {toff} bounty hunter, then why bother with a gutter-price target like you?  
  *Dialogue Options (1 & 2\) \-*   
  1 \- Not sure… Atticus Daley: Not sure, but I’d rather be in this booth than in the gutter. I at least owe him the chance to explain.

  \[…\]  
  Old: Lattice wooden screens and high backed seating provide some comfort and privacy for those that can afford it. The booths are made of a luxuriously soft calf leather, well oiled and plush with dimpled riveting. Delicate china and exclusive menus of the den’s offerings are available for those of a more discerning taste. Hot Jasmine tea steeps in a blue and white teapot.   
  Old Crone: Tonight you’re getting the special treatment. Bixby must feel bad for his doorman accosting you. Not to mention the stranger’s pocketbook— as fat as a Christmas goose. Which begs the question: Why take an interest in a penniless sot like you? You still can’t start trusting the person behind the mask.  
  *Agreed, but better than an alley-way death bed.* Agreed, but I have to admit, I’d rather be in a cosy private booth in my favourite opium den, than a vomit soaked alleyway-deathbed. Even if it’s just for tonight.

  **Masked Stranger at Booth (after Opium Dream) \-**   
  I'd rather have the player not know if Heloise is alive or not, but more likely think that she's dead by now, since so much time has passed  
  Atticus Daley: Come then, get to the brass.  
  \[...\]  
  I’ve landed on the thread of a scintillating cover-up that happens to be stitched ~~right~~ into your past.

  He splits a dose between the two teacups, stirring in contemplation. He seems to be gathering his thoughts for a drawn-out soliloquy.

  MS. Did you now? What of the dream that you just had?  
  \[...\]  
  The ledger said her age was eighty-one.  
  \[...\]  
  Atticus Daley: Hmm… but Drexel isn’t my last name.  
  Masked Stranger: She would’ve provided your father’s name at the Orphanage, to prove the legitimacy of the birth.   
  Atticus Daley: Matilda Daley…   
  Masked Stranger: If the woman committed to Sandthorne is a match, then your mother’s maiden name—at least I’m convinced—is Drexel.  
  Atticus Daley: So the ledger at Sandthorne said Tillie Drexel?   
  \[...\]  
  Animal Instinct: Even now, I’d still like to dive back in. Wiping all the feeling from my mind… it takes away the pain and everything with it.  
  Masked Stranger: But the opium has helped.  
  Atticus Daley: Right… Feels like I’ve got half a leg to stand on.   
  Masked Stranger: Well that’s something.  
  Old Crone: **He doesn’t seem to care if you live or die, and yet his knowing of your secrets has hooked you.**   
  \[...\]  
  MS:  I’m not entirely sure yet… / If I already knew, I would tell you. But as it stands, my investigation is still ongoing. But mostly, it’ has to do with the dream you just had.—  
  Atticus Daley: How would you know what I—  
  Masked Stranger: Interrupting is unbecoming of a Minotaur. So is naivete. As someone with a grasp of Illusions, you must know the many forms that Magic will take.  
  \[...\]  
  At last he drains his cup, then leans in toward you, elbows angled on the table.  
  \[...\]  
  Masked Stranger: The scratch-box is kept in the upstairs office. Locked whenever the room is located. But if we are to believe the events of your last dream, by the time you were ten, you were already a ruffian. And a rather promising burglar, particularly when tasked with a simple, warded lock.  
  Atticus Daley: Well, the bump keys I found in the basement made it easier.  
  Masked Stranger: Precocious in many ways, Mr. Daley. But don’t let it go to your head.  
  Atticus Daley: Fair enough. But anyway, I’m sure that’s not your point.  
  Masked Stranger: Not nearly. Do you remember the moment of hesitation? After you cracked the lockbox, pilfered the contents down to the ha'pennies, you listened for a moment at the door, then turned back. And what did you discover in the sliding drawer of files?  
  Atticus Daley: I— Well, I… I don’t remember.   
  Masked Stranger: It’s a good thing I’m here then. Those files contained the adoption records, as well the abandonments. Whenever a child was brought to the orphanage, either a birth certificate was supplied, or the name of the previous guardian was taken down for posterity. Your mother’s name is quite likely still buried in that drawer, but whether you found your file when you emptied the till, or else heard a bump in the hallway and made a clean sneak, there’s only a blank left in your mind.  
  \[...\]  
  MS: I’ve considered that. But I have an even better approach, grounded in reality instead of a dreamscape.   
  \[...\]  
  Masked Stranger: I’ve located the woman who I believe is your birth mother. She’s committed to an Asylum called Sandthorne, outside Camberley. An old friend who I served with in the {Indian Mutiny} was awarded the contract to renovate the old building and expand the Asylum to a full-service Mental Hospital. I took a peek at the ledgers for a separate assignment, and the name ‘Tillie Drexel’ jumped off the page.  
  \[...\]  
  MS: There’s only one Ladyship in the last fifty years by the name of Matilda Daley

  Atticus Daley: Unless a distant relative suddenly resurfaced…  
  MS: …so you must be clever. And even more so if the {bobbies} are about.  
  \[...\]  
  Atticus Daley: Even beyond what you’re suggesting, I should make amends for the {sterling} I stole.  
  Masked Stranger: It certainly couldn’t hurt, and it might get your foot in the door for the real bounty.

  PC.SPR. Then I’ll find a way inside, undetected if I have to.

  Old Crone: …cutting through the Den in a wake of trailing smoke.

  Atticus Daley: Yeah, okay, don’t dress it up dandy. Anyway, there’s only but one option this time of night — go home and get some rest.

  *Older Cuts \-* 

  Masked Stranger: I’m surprised at your indecision, I would’ve thought a quick fix wouldn’t concern you much. As I’ve gathered, you’re not much for assessing the risk of your decisions.

  Atticus Daley: I don’t need to justify my choices to you, risky maybe but my choices none the less, and it’s not like I have much to lose anyway. 

  Masked Stranger: Fair enough, perhaps a little something to take the edge off? Will give you some time to relax and take it all in. 

  Old Crone: With that, the stranger takes a small capsule from his shirtsleeve, cracks it into a porcelain teacup, and pours tea over it.

  Atticus Daley: You don't expect me to drink that...

  Old Crone: He pours the rest of the capsule into his own cup of tea with a shrug. 

  Masked Stranger: I wouldn’t poison us both, would I? Besides, if I wanted to kill you, I would’ve done it back in the alleyway.

  Atticus Daley: I’ve had it many times, My favourite, actually. 

  Old Crone: The stranger’s light-hearted confidence with everything makes me uneasy. I get the feeling the stranger knows you a lot better than I’d first wagered. 

  Atticus Daley: But you knew that already, didn’t you? First you take me to my usual place, then read my favourite strain off the menu, as if it were a coincidence.

  Old Crone: The stranger chuckles, tilting his head back and taking a sip of his own tea.

  Masked Stranger: There’s quite a lot I know about everyone, Atticus… It’s part and parcel to my profession. I must keep tabs on everyone that piques my interest 

  Atticus Daley: So you’ve been tracking me then?

  Masked Stranger: You already know the answer to that. But we’re just wasting time now. Being in the here and now is the best point of order, when more lies ahead of you than behind.

  Old Crone: At first this cryptic speech pattern was alluring in a way, but now it’s just annoying. Though I suppose it won’t do to complain. The lingering anxiety of an oncoming hangover is rearing its head, so the order of the evening is getting opium back in your bloodstream, whatever the cost.

  Atticus Daley: This isn’t going anywhere,You don’t know the first thing about me really, and I’m ready to hang up my hat. Make it a triple-pack and let me die the death of dreams.

  Masked Stranger: Soon enough, but I have a few more questions for you **before you drift off into waves of lolling poppies.**

  Atticus Daley: Alright, let’s get on with it then, what do you want to know?

  Atticus Daley: I don’t remember my mother.

  Atticus Daley: I’ve had about enough of this. What does it matter to you anyway? Those days are long gone.  

  Masked Stranger: You’ll have to trust me, but there’s something about the Sacred Heart you’ve forgotten. Something that could lead us to finding your mother.

  Atticus Daley: What do you mean… find my mother? My parents are both dead.

  Masked Stranger: Not exactly, you grew up at an orphanage but your parents are very much alive, your mother just abandoned you there all those years ago. 

  Masked Stranger: I don’t have all the answers yet, but I think a short dream-voyage would help you re-discover the missing pieces of the puzzle we both need.

  Atticus Daley: Even if that’s true, why should I want to find her? There must be a catch…

  Old Crone: You’ve had it. You can’t exist in this mess of a life you’ve made. Bixby brings over a large lacquered bowl, usually reserved for parties of four or five. He gives the stranger a worried glance, then leans over and whispers something inaudible. The stranger nods, then offers his hand, wearing a smug look that seems to assume full responsibility for the deadly amount of opium on the table. 

  Old Crone: Testing the texture with a ceramic serving spoon, you scoop out a heaping pile of the crumbly concentrate, rich and pale tan like foamy espresso. The aroma is intoxicating, making your skin crawl with yearning. 

  Old Crone: You light up, inhaling the acrid smoke deeply. The longer you hold your breath, the more that your lungs burn, crying out for oxygen. By the time you breathe out again, the red walls are misty and light seems like a lie. Darkness envelops your body and mind, as the grim angel of death appears in your vision. A hooded figure, offering a pale white hand from its cloak. A hand which you take as it pulls you to your feet. Weightless. Lacking in feeling and emotion. This is the end; the glory omniscient

  You take the stranger’s offer, eager to lose touch with harsh reality, especially with the potential to stumble upon some information concerning your mother’s whereabouts. You fall into an opium dream, where the stranger’s recent questions about your past remind you of growing up in the Sacred Heart orphanage…

  THE END… for now. 

  Other, older cuts \- 

- Attorneys and prosecutors, prison wardens, billy-clubbers and Orthodox mercenaries… Centaurs fall into law-enforcement with ease. He’s the only Centaur you’ve met who tolerates all manner of creatures, including Minotaurs.  
-   
- A packaging/prep area where the women in kimonos are prepping the goods, and you can walk up to the counter and 'take a closer look \- showing a display case of big chunks of opium wrapped up in wax paper or translucent butcher paper, sort of like bundles of hash. If the player does that, Bixby has a text-bubble appear, saying, 'we like our customers to see the process' and the Stranger has a bubble that says, 'like what you see, huh? let's get to the table then.'

  ...The stranger is still at your heels like a shadow, and the both of you follow Bixby inside, where the Red Lotus is draped in a haze of pale smoke. The opium-smell is like overdone biscuits, and only dim shapes emerge in the tendrils. The red-papered walls are etched in calligraphy, lit up by sconces laden with lanterns. Women in kimonos are floating about, carrying trays of tea and opiums. Pipes light up in the dark like cinders. 

  Priority Members avoid the central pit, opting for discretion within the private booths. Dark eyes bore down from behind wooden screens, protecting their fragile reputations. The time here is twisted in a strange uncertainty, where a string of days can pass in the course of one night. With enough capital you could dream your life away. 

  ...The walls themselves are covered with needlepoint wallpaper, a fine silk embroidery hand-painted with cherry-blossom sprays. Between patches of wallpaper is the crumbling brick of the old foundation, drilled with iron sconces and prickets for grease lamps. Low-burning lanterns hang from the ceiling on thin wires obscured by the smoke so they appear to be floating. Wrapped in red glass, they cast a rosy glow about the room. Red painted canvases hang on the walls, with delicate calligraphy of Chinese characters: symbols of luck, friendship, and wealth among others. 

  Ghostly women in kimonos move about, opening red-lacquered cabinets for tea and opium. They carry trays with china-handled teapots and repeating-matches, flitting down mostly to the main floor, where the men are too strung-out to light their own pipes. In this case, the staff holds the pipe to the patrons’ lips. Shadowy figures peer out from the private booths, seemingly more in control of their blue-smoke dreamscapes. They’re well-dressed and hidden by the latticed cherrywood screens, as if they had reputations to ruin if seen here. 

  ...Mahogany bunk beds run along the walls, their frames carved with Chinese characters—luck, friendship, wealth, and so on. Between them are the private booths and cushy benches. Red-velvet brocade curtains hang from the crossbeams, creating privacy for those who can afford it. The beds and deluxe seating roundabout the room in a horseshoe shape, circling the largest bit of territory—the pit. 


  …They won’t receive tea with their simple ivory pipes. The white-jade pipes with bands of shagreen; those are reserved for the flash clientele. When the men on the main floor run out of money, they’re given some water to cope with their cotton-mouth, then promptly led through the back door to the street. They might only be gone for a few hours, however long it takes to beggar some more pence. 

  ...As for yourself, the main floor is usually all you can afford. \[...\] But tonight you’re getting special treatment. Bixby must feel bad for his cousin accosting you. Not to mention the stranger’s pocketbook— as fat as a Christmas goose. Which begs the question: Why take an interest in a penniless sot like you? You still can’t start trusting the person behind the mask. But you have to admit, you’d rather be in a cosy private booth in your favourite opium den, than the vomit soaked alleyway-deathbed you came from.

  ...Bixby Browncoat: What’s all this commotion? What have you done with my new bouncer? 

  Masked Stranger: Sorry about that.

  Atticus Daley: He was getting pretty rowdy.

  Bixby Browncoat: Well if he lays there unconscious, he’ll die\!

  Old Crone: Bixby rushes over to get his fellow Centaur to his feet. The stranger passes Bixby a jar of smelling-salts.

  Masked Stranger: This’ll help.

  Bixby Browncoat: Bull’s Head, eh? I’ve got my own bottle, but thanks.

  Old Crone: Bixby produces a tiny glass bottle, uncorking under the Bouncer’s nose.

  ...Old Crone: You grumble and look back at the Bouncer, now poring over the List.

  Atticus: 

  Mutton-brained sot…

  Bixby, this place is going to the dogs.

  There’s just no respect anymore, I suppose I should stop expecting it.

  Bixby Browncoat: Just between us… And, well, this… strapping fellow you’ve brought alongside. Unfortunately, hiring the doorman was a family matter.

  Atticus: Don’t tell me you’re related?

  Oh Bixby… you can usually escape that kind of squeeze. What happened?

  That’s unfortunate…  to say the least.

  Bixby Browncoat: Yes… well, he’s a cousin… a distant cousin… Long story short; I couldn’t avoid it. He would’ve joined up with the billy-clubbers or blue banders if I didn’t task him here.

  Old Crone: Bixby is bright-red. He’d rather not admit any of this, nor explain further… 

  Atticus Daley: 

  Better a doorman than a copper. I get it. Family ties… 

  Come now, Bixby… don’t tell me you’re going soft.

  Hmm… I always thought I was welcome here… But if it’s family over the customer, I may have to seek out my vices elsewhere. 

  Bixby Browncoat: Oh, heavens no\! It’s nothing like that. Nepotism can move like a cancer, and Ol’ Bixby still has a backbone when it comes to the nitty gritty. The Docklands shall never fall to the sway of the vapid capitalists. Not on my watch. 

  Old Crone: Bixby whickers, tossing his head like a frisky foal. You’ve set him off, now… motormouth churning like a turbine.

  Bixby Browncoat: The East End is corrupted enough with the Dockhounds and all the other murder-gangs… socketing the wealth away from the underclass, meanwhile bringing in heat from the billy-clubbers. And if those skiving criminals aren’t behind all this orphan-napping…  well, I’ll eat my pocket watch.

  Old Crone: Bixby is so wound up, he stifles a whinny.

  Bixby Browncoat: How's that, then? A centaur opposed to the brigadiers in blue? If that doesn’t explain myself, then colour me mumchance. Being anti-police doesn’t match my bloodline… So I’ll tell you again, Atticus, just like I tell all my regulars—and you’ll believe me or not… You’re always welcome: with or without the Illusion.

  Old Crone: Bixby’s horsey grin is so unassuming, you can’t help but forgive him outright. 

  Atticus Daley: 

  Never had a family myself. But I understand—sort of. 

  Okay, Bixby. Water under the bridge. 

  Just… do better next time.

  Bixby Browncoat: Right then, how about that tea? Come along now, to the private deluxe.

  Old Crone: Bibxy ushers you in through the hidden door. The stranger follows behind you like a stubborn shadow.

  ...Old Crone: You grumble and look back at the Bouncer, now poring over the List.

  ...Never seen our little friend here fight / Never seen your little tin toy in a scuffle

  ...His two articulating arms are carrying a tray of tea, with black-jade teapot and a single teacup, along with a pipe and jar of opium.

  ...Suddenly a hot jet of steam bursts from the back of the volleyball-sized robot. The pint-sized mechanical leaps onto the table, sending the trayful of tea into brief levitation. The mech plants his pressurised feet onto the table, then slides the tray whip-fast to catch the falling items, everything clattering back down in reassemblage. 

  “Right you are, Sir. There are many a human obstacle in my duty to serve,” the automaton chides, his head spinning back to glare at you and the stranger for a split-second.

  The dwarf chuckles, then leans over in your direction. “Sorry about Otto. Hasn’t much for an empathy algorithm. Maybe I’ll sort that on the next one.” 

  The dwarf has a warm and amiable look, with the sort of lucid blue eyes you can’t stay angry at. His gaze is so sharp and clearly intelligent, that you find yourself intrigued, as opposed to annoyed. Below his crystal-blue eyes is a broad nose and a red moustache which is so full, you expect it may crawl off his face and build a cocoon. His beard is as red as a skinned rabbit, and braided and brass-ringed in the common style. By reflex, you finger the brass ring in your own goatee. It’s stringy and coarse compared to the dwarf’s beard, which spilled out in red waves on the table. A calabash tobacco pipe waggles from his mouth, and whenever he chuckles, the embers dance and glow. The dwarf has a mechanised-arm for his left, and although you cannot see below the table, you get the impression he has quite a few more  augmentations. 

  Protruding from behind his head is an induction spark-coil, attached to a backpack the dwarf is either wearing, or has welded to his back-plate armour. Although the coil is not currently twisting with lightning-waves, incandescent bulbs burn along the iron frame, so the dwarf must have energy saved up in the dry-cells of his power-pack. Black steam burps out from a small boiler-top, jutting out from the side at a right angle.

  Taking in the dwarf’s mechanical modifications, you decide to play it off like nothing happened. “Some kind of inventor, are you? Designed that rickety thing?”

  “Right you are. The name’s Theodore. Theodore Redgrave. But most people just call me Teddy. This little bucket of brass here is Otto. Doesn’t care much for other people, but that’s in his programming. Can’t blame him, really. I’m the one who can’t build a better action-grid. Those Babbage machines have all the best patents. Need me a lassie who can work me a new algorithm. Then I’ll get ahead of those Mods and start my own firm. Anyway, I’m sorry if he got in your way. Can I get you lads a cuppa tea to set things right?”

  “We’ve got the tea coming already, thanks,” the stranger says curtly.

  You open your mouth to say something, but suddenly, your tongue feels too large for your mouth. You glance quickly at the stranger, who’s muttering under his breath, and you realise he’s cursed you again. He doesn’t want you to talk to Teddy Redgrave for some reason. And if you ever want your tongue to return to normal size, you figure it’s best to go along with what the stranger wants. You stare wide-eyed at the dwarf in the next booth, who stares back for a moment with a quizzical look. He was expecting you to say something, but eventually he shrugs and turns away.

  “Alright then,” Teddy says. “I'll let you get on with it.”

  Just as your tongue shrinks down to its normal size, Bixby appears with the tea and two menus. Bixby sets down a tray of piping-hot tea, fanning out the menus with his other muscle-corded arm. He gives you both a wink and small nod, then steps away. “Take all the time you need. Remember, Atticus, you should feel at home here.”

  Grunting your thanks to Bixby, …

  ...Teddy Redgrave: Banned by the Lupine Anti-Segregation Society. But the LASS couldn’t keep things bottled up for long. Besides, the Merry Melee just went underground. And even the most ardent of Lassies understood that the whole matter is far more humane within the zone. Sanctioned and watched over by the Lords and their bobbies. 

  Masked Stranger: Fascinating, to be sure. 

  …“Not quite.” you grumble nonchalantly. “What’s the latest?” 

  …Bixby smiles eagerly, happy to make a sale. “I’m glad you asked, Atticus. We just received shipment of a very fine Midnight Molasses. Grown here in London. Westminster, if I’m not mistaken. A small couple of greenhouses looked after by a family with ties to the Far East. Surely, just like the real thing, but you know since another Opium War has just started up, I can’t be ordering anything from over that way…”

  “The local sourcing is much less complicated,” the stranger drawls in a cold tone, clearly ready for Bixby’s recitation to end.

  “Oh yes,” Bixby says, narrowing his eyes a little. “You must be quite the businessman yourself, to have picked up so easily on my habit of keeping my customers out of harm’s way.”

  “But of course,” the stranger says. “Wouldn’t want anyone falling prey to the Eastern Triad.”

  “I should say not\!” Bixby says, his face flushing. “The cartels have been awful for business, demanding a vig with every shipment. Now that our products are grown here in London… I assure you. All my customers are much safer.” 

  “And what about the ones who overdose?” the stranger asks.

  “We do not allow the service when a customer gets anywhere close to the edge. Reading the signs is very simple. And besides, we have the adrenaline needles if it should come to that. Which it never has, in all my seventeen years of operation. Now, if the inquisition is over, I hope you’ll excuse me. Wave down one of the staff when you’re ready to order.”

  Bixby trots off in a huff, staring daggers at the stranger before ducking behind a curtain.

  You turn to the stranger with a prying glance. “What was that all about?” 

  …He gestures to the brass menus, monogrammed with the Red Lotus logo. “That is… if you want to partake.”

  ...With a glance at the stranger, who’s also reading the menu, you sit back and relax on the patent leather cushions. The private booths are soft, yet firmly supportive, and the armrests are riveted with plush rabbit-skin.

  ...Discarding the thought in your excitement to pick a dose, you return your focus to the parchment-size bronze menu.

  There’s quite a few selections of opium here at the den, owing to the industry’s steam-hydroponic cultivation of the poppy. With the advent of Ultraviolet-Argon gas lamps, countless new opium strains had been developed through cross-breeding and genetic manipulation. Anyone with a steam-boiler and the chops to build a greenhouse could grow all sorts of things in the comfort of their personal residence. 

  A brave new world of drug cultivation was upon Britain, and every day the horticultural experts were making new discoveries. If there was anything keeping you wandering the cold streets through the tatters of your life, it was checking up on Bixby’s latest additions to the menu.

  …“Not quite.” you grumble nonchalantly. “What’s the latest?” 

  Bixby smiles eagerly, happy to make a sale. “I’m glad you asked, Atticus. We just received shipment of a very fine Midnight Molasses. Grown here in London. Westminster, if I’m not mistaken. A small couple of greenhouses looked after by a family with ties to the Far East. Surely, just like the real thing, but you know since another Opium War has just started up, I can’t be ordering anything from over that way…”

  “The local sourcing is much less complicated,” the stranger drawls in a cold tone, clearly ready for Bixby’s recitation to end.

  “Oh yes,” Bixby says, narrowing his eyes a little. “You must be quite the businessman yourself, to have picked up so easily on my habit of keeping my customers out of harm’s way.”

  “But of course,” the stranger says. “Wouldn’t want anyone falling prey to the Eastern Triad.”

  “I should say not\!” Bixby says, his face flushing. “The cartels have been awful for business, demanding a vig with every shipment. Now that our products are grown here in London… I assure you. All my customers are much safer.” 

  “And what about the ones who overdose?” the stranger asks.

Which it never has, in all my seventeen years of operation. Now, if the inquisition is over, I hope you’ll excuse me. Wave down one of the staff when you’re ready to order.”

  Bixby trots off in a huff, staring daggers at the stranger before ducking behind a curtain.

  You turn to the stranger with a prying glance. “What was that all about?” 

  ...

  ...“Do you recall the incessant bullying, perhaps?”

  “Of course. A whole gang of insolent children, up against a circus freak like me… what do you expect?”

  …You sit back on the pillows, crossing your arms. “Out with it, then.”

  …cryptic oratory style. 

...Cocaine and turmeric powder. One counteracts the other— Makes for a pleasant mood.   
...Sliding out the fibrillated catchment in the bowl, you’re able to pack in another heaping scoop.

...The stranger's affluence has afforded you. Your headache still gnaws at you and the dim light of the opium den make it difficult to focus. You look over every possible option with a hunger that seems to come not from your stomach, but the remnants of your soul.   
...Atticus Daley: Or maybe I’ve been so unhappy my whole life because I never tasted the finer things.  
...Old Crone: The stranger raises a hand, and Bixby promptly appears from behind the wall of red curtains.  
Bixby Browncoat: Yes, sir? Have you decided?  
Atticus Daley: Not quite yet...  
Bixby Browncoat: I’ll give you a few more moments…   
Old Crone: Bixby trots away again.  
...Old Crone: Before you can answer, another headache grips you. You need something to take the edge off—quickly. As if reading your mind, the stranger takes a small capsule from his shirtsleeve, cracks it into a porcelain teacup and pours tea over it.  
...in the pre-dinner lull. Which reminds me, you look hungry… Should we order you something to eat?”  
Atticus Daley: They serve food here? I’ve never noticedYou laugh suddenly, in spite of your sour mood. “You didn’t think they actually served food here?”   
Masked Stranger: Doesn’t surprise me, too concerned with your next fix to notice. “The staff has to eat something. I can read it on their faces… These poor women are working at least ten-hour shifts. Besides, I thought you might be able to smell the noodle-broth in the back.”  
“I must not have noticed,” you say. “But that doesn’t mean they’ll serve us.”   
“They will if I ask nicely.”  
Old Crone: And with that, the stranger motions toflags down Bixby who nods quickly and heads one of the wait-staff. A woman in a red kimono.  
When she appears, the stranger whispers a few words into her ear. The woman giggles and nods, then hurries back behind the curtains at the back.   
“See?” the stranger says. Masked Stranger: There, “aAll taken care of. Now take a sip of that tea, and tell me what you’d like… for after the lo mein.”  
Old Crone:You’re sure he must’ve cast a spell on the woman in the kimono. You’ve never seen anyone eating in here. Impressive as the stranger is, you still can’t figure out why he would want anything to do with a strung-out Minotaur such as yourself.   
...The steaming noodles are setting your mouth to water. But the stranger reminds you of your question—   
...“I’ve got a few more questions, first,” the stranger says.   
“Bullocks… I’m ready to blast off. Let’s have the sticky stuff.”   
“**Before you drift off into waves of lolling poppies**, allow me a few more morsels…”  
“Morsels?” you ask, with a glance at the noodles.  
“Kernels of information, my boy. If it please you to erase your mortal imprint, at least lend me a few more fragments…”  
You grumble and narrow your eyes. “I take it you won't cover this until I’ve spoken up?”  
The stranger nods.  
“Fine… what do you want to know?”  
...You’re shocked and confused for a moment, but then realise it wouldn’t be hard to check the register at the Orphanage you were born in. Slurping down the last of your noodles, you sit back to craft a response.  
...Atticus Daley: What sort of details?  
Masked Stranger: Was there not one Sister in particular who came to your aid, helping you develop the illusion you rely on so constantly in your underground comings and goings?”  
Old Crone: You’re growing more and more exasperated.   
Atticus Daley: Yes. But if you already know so much, then why not get on with it, what more do you need of me?let’s place an order. Come now…  
Masked Stranger: Sister Heloise, was it?  
Old Crone: Gritting your teeth, you nod and drink down the rest of your tea.   
Masked Stranger: One more item of small concern: Your mother.  
Atticus Daley: I don’t remember my mother. That's what makes me an orphan\! Chrissake…   
...And what a shame that is. But a man of my position is privy to the top-shelf selections, namely the Whitewind Elation; which I gather is a favourite as of late.  
Atticus Daley: Bully… What of it?   
Masked Stranger: It’s quite an appropriate catalyst for memory retrieval.  
Atticus Daley: That so?  
Masked Stranger: In high enough doses.”  
Atticus Daley: I’ve never had more than a single-pack. How much higher?  
Old Crone: The stranger’s eyes sparkle from his kohl-black sockets.   
*Masked Stranger: Somewhere just below the death-dose you seem so keen on.”*  
*Atticus Daley: And what’s the good of digging up my painful memories?*  
...Atticus Daley: Bully… What of it?

*Atticus Daley: And what’s the good of digging up my painful memories?*  
...Old Crone: Your next sip of tea comes spluttering over the table. Even after all this time, you kept a glimmer of hope alive, that by some flukey odds your mother might still be alive. You’ve always hoped she was a Minotaur, or at least maybe your father was, and that she might be able to help you find him. Minotaurs are very rare, living on the margins of society. The idea of one day meeting your mother has been the only thing keeping you from drinking yourself into a death-ward gin spiral. But how could the mysterious stranger know?   
Waiting for the shock to settle into your bones, at last the stranger clears his throat.   
...“I seriously doubt that,” you say.   
“Anyway, I would appreciate your candour, but I can’t force you to do anything. So… what’ll it be? The dream-dose… or the death-dose?”  
...When Bixby is gone, the stranger serves himself a small amount and lights up, falling back into the chuffy silk pillows. The rest of the bowl is all for you, filled with your sweet release.  
...The end of all chaos and form in this world.

...Your words tumble out in shaky breaths.  
... Turning your eyes to the stranger, you offer an open palm. 

- And more cuts...  
  ...Old Crone: The stranger pauses, pouring out the last of the teapot. Right on cue, another tray is laid on the table by one of the women in silk-kimonos drifting about.

...The stranger shakes his head, leaning back and folding his hands.

**Death and dream dose screens**  
ALT: You cannot hold on to this mess of life you’ve made. When the order arrives, the server gives the stranger a worried glance, but the stranger waves him off with a look that assumes full responsibility for the deadly amount of opium on the table. The crumbly concentrate is the colour of espresso, and the smell makes your skin crawl with yearning. Lighting up, inhaling to the bottom of your breath, you hold in the smoke while your lungs cry for oxygen. If you ever exhale, you don’t feel it happen, but the red walls are misty and light seems to be telling lies. Darkness envelops your body and mind, as the angel of death appears in a wisp of smoke. The hooded figure offers a pale hand, pulling your soul from the weight of your body. This is the end, the Glory Omniscient.

###### **ORPHANAGE (FLASHBACKS):**

You take the stranger’s offer, eager to lose touch with harsh reality. You fall into an opium dream, where the stranger’s recent questions about your past remind you of growing up at the Sacred Heart Orphanage.   
Gauzy light streaks in through a window. Lying in a musty dormitory bed, you wake to the sight of a nurse sitting beside you. She has a kind smile and mousy brown hair. This is Heloise Clements, the only nun at the orphanage who ever took pity on you.  
As you come back to consciousness, Heloise presents a fresh bandage for your head, tending to one of the many wounds you sustained in the dooryard scuffles with the bellicose children at the Sacred Heart. If they weren’t hurling stones or insults, they were ignoring you completely. The pain of this unjustified state of affairs is reflected in her eyes, welling with tears of comprehension, as her hands wrap the bandage around the wound.  
**SPLASHSCREEN SUPERIMPOSE \- Sacred Heart Orphanage: Twenty-Five Years Ago**   
\[...\]  
Another gauzy memory, all floating particles of uncorporeal light… Children are gathered in the dooryard, encircling you, shouting something at you. The dooryard is all wild grass and the high-summer air is so close that it’s cruel. And it hurts to remember… They’re demanding something… that’s it… they want you to perform your Illusion.  
The Orphanage was always presided over by the local Parish. A few members of the House of Lords and their philanthropic wives had made donations, but for the most part the Church provided the Sisters with barely enough provisions to go around. There were no second helpings, unless stolen from another plate. The hunger in the boys’ bellies spilled into their social hierarchy; a fountain of bilious fear turned to anger.   
Some of the older orphans went out in the early mornings to work at the Shipyards, or seek out odd jobs in the streets. One of them, Leo, had even built his own bicycle-cabriolet, and spent his days shuttling day-wagers around the city. Leo was as close as you ever got to a friend here. But he’s timid and gangly, and in no position to defend you from the boy leading the chant—James Marker. You will have to face Jimmy on your own.

Rain pounds the windows and lightning flashes. All the way up the stairs and you’re crouching at the office door, with the hand-torch and the bump keys you stole from the custodian closet, quietly trying each key in the office door, unless the delightful clicking sound is heard.   
It’s a shame to have betrayed the haggard Cyclops custodian, who is the only non-Human soul at the Sacred Heart. But you’ve reached the point of no return, and burying your guilt, you slip inside the office, where the money you need for escape might await you.

On the eve of your thirteenth birthday, you lie awake going over your plan, and when you’re sure that the last night-owl is asleep, you creep from the dormitory bedroom on bare hooves, trying your best to muffle the sound of your hoofsteps. \[...\] An (Intuition Check) compels Young Atticus to keep searching the office… Atticus Daley: I’ve already lost their trust by breaking in… So what else can I find? The Player stumbles over a file cabinet stuffed with loose sheafs of printed records on parchment. Your name is among them, and just as you slide your file out, you hear footsteps coming down the hallway. There’s no time to read over your records, so you quickly hide the Lockbox inside your patched overcoat. \[...\] There’s enough money in the lockbox to last you a few months on your own—enough time to get far, far away from the Sacred Heart. \[...\] Tumbling out the window and into a hedgerow, you slip away unnoticed from the Orphanage, ready to carve out a life of your own. Yet twenty-five years later, you’re a full-grown Minotaur, still scrappy and homeless. If there’s any Virtues you have left, it’s your gnawing search for belonging and a passion for the ways of Magic and Illusions.  
\[...\]  
INS: Oh yes, the Royals will avoid scandal at all costs.   
PC: And defend any action in service to Britain’s international reputation. Any means are justified, so long as they serve the best interest of all British citizens.  
Old Crone: You would have a shot in politics, Atticus.  
PC: I’ll take that as a compliment…

ORPHANAGE \- DORM \- NIGHT WITHIN DREAM \#1 — That Cyclops is the only other non-Human soul at Sacred Heart, treated like filth by reason of blood. But there’s no turning back now. Burying your guilt, you gather your determination.  
\[...\]  
The outlash against your Minotaur blood is incomprehensible to your developing mind, and despite the best efforts of the Sisters, you’ve begun stealing for sport—rosaries from church, gimcrack shivs from the older orphans, and bread from the kitchen. 

###### **ORPHANAGE (IN PERSON):**

Old Loading Screen (EXT)  
The cobblestones glisten with dew as you breathe deep of the brisk morning air. Your mood rising with the sun, you’re beginning to understand the merits of getting up early. You turn down the Sorris Square backstreet leading to the orphanage. The sagging facade is weathered and stripped, shuttered by pine flats where the windows were broken—it’s even shabbier now than when you ran away.  
Pain and regret twist your insides at the sight. You wish you had never stolen from the Sisters, but there’s no way to reverse your transgression, only make good on it if you can. You press on through the morning mist, which seems to conceal vaporous faces from your past—Heloise, Matilda, even the ruthless bullies of your childhood. At last you step free of the clinging mist and into the cobbled forecourt, where a {bluebander} stands guard at a barricade, observing your approach with a smug grin. You nod politely, and he summons his best sneer, as if you were something to scrape from the bottom of his boot.

  Old Loading Screen (INT)  
  The police barriers are gone and you step through the doors without issue, but things have certainly changed here at the Sacred Heart. Without the bobbies watching over affairs, some kind of evil Magic like a dark cloud seems to have settled in. A cold wind travels through the overhanging beams at the entrance, wailing between the wood grains, as if trying to split them, erode the structure of the whole building from inside out. A dark energy has swept in when the coppers took their leave.  
  A cold shiver runs down your spine, surveying the chipped and yellowed wall-tiles, in silent testimony to the horrors that have transpired over so many years. The wood floors have long since stopped being polished, and the smell of pine is missing now, replaced with a heavy musk of decay within each particle of air.   
  Ahead of you sits one of the sisters, at a steel table with the legs sorely battered and bashed-in. She’s bitterly focused on some paper she’s reading. There’s a murmur of voices overhead, which can only be the children committed to the grim uncertainty here. Perhaps in the washroom, there’s a dripping pipe that echoes along the corridor attached to the foyer.

- Way back in the day, the nun who the Player seeks out through the ‘hunt for clues’ ends up being able to help, because she’d been keeping tabs on Matilda out of sympathy, since she sensed something amiss (forced to give up child, not only because of Minotaur race, but b/c of husband’s pressure, and she doesn’t buy how a mother would so easily let go of her own child--in reality Matilda does it so that her husband will not murder Atticus).   
- Everdeen had had Matilda in her mind for many years, and knew her name from the paper’s announcement of being sent to the Sanitarium by her well-known politician husband, as it was something of a scandal at the time.   
- (+1 Integrity) — Being honest, especially with yourself, will add Points to Integrity, as Atticus faces his fear of being judged by others, thereby accepting and releasing his own demons.

###### **DREAM SPACE:**

###### **GARRET:**

- Item 3: Foot Locker (Sound Cue — TBD) *Collapsed into other storage interactable (Wardrobe)*  
- Foot Locker: A timeworn and weather-beaten trunk, reinforced with nickel-plated hoops and steel rivets. You found it on the leeward side of a small-town railway station, free for the taking.  
- WIT. Along with the pile of carpet bags on the floor, this area’s well suited for whatever you’d rather keep at home.

- \[...\]  
- ...Also inside is a Journal. Picking up this item opens the Journal Page, where **the Player is prompted to write down the events of that day**. They may refuse to, clicking ‘Not now.’ If choosing to write, all they have to do is type in two sentences, which show up on the parchment as legible, cursive letters. (They could write nonsense, but I hope some players will actually reflect on the events of the game, and could make for share-worthy content for the game-community.) After at least ten words and two periods have been inputted, a text box appears which says, ‘That’s all for now.’ Player can keep writing, but will eventually click the box to move on. Everytime the Player journals the events of the day, it will add a point to Intellect, Focus, and Persuasion (unbeknownst to the Player). Also, after the first time journaling, they unlock an option to read the previous journal entries (Player can write their own entries).

  ...Vagrants and lowlifes mill about the Square. At least one crime appears to be occurring, a cross between a stewbum-fight and a debt-collection. You catch only a few words, something about rat-baiting. You even recognize one of the brawlers, but there’s no time to step in. Your bandy legs can barely guide you home, and between patches of tarvy, you stumble on a jutting cobblestone, chipping your hoof. Cursing your drug-ravaged body, you nevertheless find the energy to ankle along down the cobbles.

- **Angus Malone (Original)**  
  Angus Malone has a shiny bald head and rusty-blond Donegal beard. His arms are wallpapered with blue and black tattoos. He’s still having a task with cleaning the glasses, so he only offers an indistinct grumble when you approach. Based on your frequent patronage, the two of you are well-acquainted. Malone drinks like a sailor, and yet you’ve never heard him slurring his words or seen his hands shake—his tolerance is that high. Strongly proud of his Scottish kinship, he’s always blaming the Irish for the most belligerent of hijinks, claiming the Scottish hold their liquor far better. Angus Malone has a penchant for stories and gossip, so the only way he will serve you during his prep-time is to butter him up.  
  Angus Malone: See now chappie, gotta pay up first. Conversation comes with the price of admission.  
  Atticus Daley: Can I see the menu?  
  Angus Malone: Right then, if yeh’ wanna be a dandy ‘bout pickin’ out yeh’ poison, here’s yer’ ruddy choices.

  (Camera zooms out. The man hunched over his notebook is now in view. He sips from a highball glass. He’s an artsy poet who is hoping to channel the underbelly of the East End into great literature (name TBD). Atticus will need his help for a later mission.)  
  Atticus Daley: You’re right… She's just my type.  
  Angus Malone: What’s that, ay?  
  Atticus Daley: Oh nothing, just wondering who that woman is.  
  \[EDIT \- CLARA NO LONGER APPEARS HERE, she's introduced during he performance\]  
  Angus Malone: Oh yeah, seen her here a lot. She’ll be singin’ a bit later, if I’m not mistaken. Some kind of Burlesque show. It’s not my cuppa’ tea but you might like it.  
  Atticus Daley: A breakfast cocktail, I see. Cut from the same cloth, perhaps.   
  Angus Malone: I wouldn’t count on any attention from her. Seems to hang around the high-rollers, mostly.   
  Old Crone: You raise your glass in her direction, and she gives you a wink that’s so subtle, she might’ve just been blinking the tobacco smoke from her eyes. You drain your glass and feel ready for another one.  
  Angus Malone: There ya have it boy… The old cold shoulder. Not even worth buying her swill. Need another yerself?  
  Atticus Daley: Oh yeah, I’m just getting started.  
  Angus Malone: The same?

  **Old Crone: Would you forgive me if I offered you advice?**   
  **Atticus Daley: What are you, my mother? I can take care of myself.**   
  Old Crone: Says the man who wakes up in the back alley covered stale beer and vomit.   
  Atticus Daley: Alright, fine. What is it you recommend?  
  Old Crone: Just try to control yourself if you get on a hot-streak, which you will only hit if you stay right in the gin-pocket. Too many shots of dram could put you on the floor, with a billiards-cue held to your throat for your last penny.  
  Atticus Daley: Ha\! A little dram? That and the gin I can handle. It’s only bad luck I can’t abide.  
  Old Crone: It’s only a small piece of advice…   
  Atticus Daley: I get it. I’ll be careful.

- **Original Load Screen (Night 1 \- After Gambling)**  
  After your lucky night, your head is full of steam and the bar is full of smoke, dancing and music. There’s still that clawing feeling that you could lose it all, but somehow you know you won't, because you don’t want to. And at least for now, while the vigour is high, the stage lights are low, and the anticipation of the Burlesque program is thick in the air, there’s nothing you’d rather do but toss back another glass of gin, ideally some variety in the latest taste—Beefeater, even—as money is no object, and relish in your good luck.  
  The ceiling is awash in the colourful lights of a hyper-sequenced magic lantern show being shuffled in rainbow-hued shadowplay. A red-velvet curtain is drawn across the stage, but a full band of ragtime instruments can be heard behind it, tuning up and ready to accompany the illustrious singer of the evening, whose name is in marquis lights above the stage — Clara Reed. You recognize the name, having been to the Palladium many times, but because of the bewildering clouds of gin and laudanum burdening your memory, you cannot recall her face, nor the tenor of her voice. It must be another sprig of luck—catching the show just as you came up from the Parlor. Excitement runs through your veins like electricity.   
    
- **Bar \- Day 2**  
  - You agree to head to Gravesend Manor to shakedown the Baron.   
  - Mr Betteredge: Your target was here last night. You’ll head to his Estate and retrieve what is still owed.  
  - Atticus Daley: I’ve got no quarrel with this man, whoever he is.  
  - Mr Betteredge: Atticus, you must account for your own debts somehow. And we know what a grand success you’ve been at this sort of work in the past.  
  - Old Crone: His grim smile shivers your spine, reminding you of the blood that’s been spilled at your hands, all in pursuit of the ever-mounting pile of gambling debts.  
  - Atticus Daley: Dammit, Crone, you don’t think I remember that already?  
  - Old Crone: You’re right, I apologise. I shouldn’t stick around just to send you spiralling. But at the same time, you don’t seem to have a choice.  
  - Mr Betteredge: Stop that mumbling at once\! You’ll do what I ask, and then we’ll confer, and if anything goes awry, you won’t survive our next meeting.

###### **PALLADIUM (after Serum Delivery):**

- OLD. Can’t head to the orphanage in the middle of the night. The kids are all asleep, not to mention the Sisters.

A crime of passion, but also an end to what would have been the Dorrison-Dufrain bloodline.

#### *Notes Outtakes*

- Because there aren’t many, the Stranger wants to groom you into a powerful Minotaur Mage, so as to unlock this hidden treasure of a magical sceptre with Midas-like powers of turning things into pure gold. He thinks the sceptre is buried in a Minotaur-access only vault inside an underground cult of Minotaur magicians, who have a hideout in the catacombs beneath Paris, and that they themselves don’t even know that the sceptre is there, for the famous magician who had it, hid it very well because he knew people would fight bloody, greedy wars to possess it—too dangerous for anyone to own, so this Ancient Minotaur tried to hide it forever.

###### **VELVET ROSE:** 

- This Easy Task (sneaking back through the Bedroom) has a high chance of succeeding, and even the failure results end with the Derringer back in Clara’s hands, so that the Player feels accomplished right away. The Player hits the streets again, but on her way back to her room, the Royal Suite at the Bell Jar Hotel

###### **Hints for Clara**

- Zora's Diary: The final clue that's quite difficult to come by, needs to be stolen from her apartment with a set of high skill checks, or else procured by another NPC, maybe Lefty Broan or Molly or a courtesan who Clara persuades to steal it from Zora. Written in Bruslavian, Clara needs either Nina or Ivana to translate it for her (both speak Bruslavian), and the Diary details every murder she committed, as well as intentions to frame Sykes the Werewolf. This 'nail in the coffin' clue is enough to convict Zora AND prove Sykes is innocent.

- Did things go differently here because of magic and myth?  
- How has steam technology affected the relationship between colonisers and indigenous states?  
- I'm particularly fascinated by the question of what Aztec and Mayan culture would look like in the 1800s. Would their way of life change to accommodate European society (as Japan did), or would they stay true to their old ways?  
- As above, it would also be interesting to see how Europe's culture might be influenced by the export of art, artefacts, traditions, etc. from Mayan/Aztec cities  
- How would someone from those cultures adapt to life in the old world?

#### *Roma / Romani*

- From Sheila: Need to be cautious about using the word gypsy outright. We could also shift the history of our specific setting in such a way that that term never came about. Perhaps the Romani people just weren't misnamed as such by Europeans during the 16th century in our world and/or adopted a different moniker. Hard to say what's most sensible. Obvi.  
- Could find serendipitous ways to refer to Romani characters that just don't make use of the slur unless it's a sequence where it's being called out the the one from Scott above. Simply use their name, or other characteristics (A woman from Brisbane with dark hair, or what have you). It certainly might be a bit of thought, but at the end of the day, it's not really our story to personally tell, and likely worth the effort

- Gwyllgi (either gwyllt "wild" or gwyll "twilight" \+ ci "dog") \- mythical black dog from Wales that appears as an English mastiff with baleful breath and blazing red eyes. Baleful meaning deadly/noxious. Mastiffs are distinguished by enormous size, massive head, short coat in a limited range of colours, and always displaying a black mask  
- In English folklore, [Black Shuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Shuck), Old Shuck, Old Shock or simply Shuck is the name given to a ghostly black dog which is said to roam the coastline and countryside of East Anglia, one of many such black dogs recorded in folklore across the British Isles.

#### 

#### *Cyclopes*

- From at least the fifth century BC, cyclopes have been associated with the island of Sicily and the volcanic Aeolian Islands. Humans being the dominant race, they gave our cyclopes this ‘homeland’ sanctuary as recompense for all the land that had been forcibly removed from in the past in order to establish human-dominated cities with human-dominated political systems that rewarded humans above minority races. But, nobody really wanted to settle or develop or harvest resources on the Aeolian Islands anyway, so human leaders who made the deal didn’t feel like it was a raw one for them, and they got to save face against progressive public scrutiny. By the time Atticus wakes up in the ally, the Aeolian Islands are developed and fitted out with luxury homes, hotels, religious temples, museums, and the wealthy elite cyclopes all either own property there or dream of purchasing it in the future.  
- Akin to the Mythology, our cyclopes were involved in blacksmithing, talented metalworkers by nature, resistant the heat and arduous conditions, able to maintain focus on the red-hot molten point of a blade, without the need for depth of field specific to detailed work that dwarves and even humans had a better knack for.   
- Because of genetic complications by breeding cyclopes with one another, their numbers became scarce, and the single eye being recessive meant that hybrids would often pass for another ethnicity, which gave them more privileges, leaving the single eyed cyclopes to be often-labelled as ‘monsters.’

#### 

#### *Lycans / Werewolves*

#### 

- The socially acceptable/civilised thing is to commit oneself each month, but some people avoid doing it for fear of being discriminated against—leading to werewolf hunters often called to deal with them outside containment (especially wealthy ones who might otherwise conceal their status). Containment areas are lawless zones for one day a month, poorly managed and profit motivated. You can have illegal fights and gambling, and people punished by crimes or vendettas by being thrown inside, and also falsely reported as werewolves for political reasons—committed against their will without evidence. Teddy Redgrave is a for-hire trophy monster-hunter, who’s hunted minotaurs before, so he can smell Atticus.  
- In England at least, those with Lycanthropy are required to register, which affects their employment opportunities, access to medical care and services, etc. Collection of the "lycans'' or some other slang could begin a few days before the full moon. They all get rounded up if they don't submit themselves voluntarily. So when Atticus checks the gate, it says, "With just a few days until the next full moon the containment zone is already starting to fill up with the more willing and civil among the **afflicted(*wc*)**, but there's always an element of risk when dealing with their kind." or something to that effect.   
- In Bruslavia (made up country in the Balkans), a vast-majority werewolf nation, the virus is known as Vukašin (meaning son of wolf)  
- A couple days later, Teddy escorts Atticus to an abandoned warehouse in the containment zone for the bare knuckle boxing match, knowing that he's a minotaur. The fight then occurs on the full moon with the werewolf and minotaur in natural form. If Atticus wants to bet on himself (or against himself) he has to use his illusion form as they won't let fighters bet on themselves.  
- Only humans are affected by the virus. Minotaurs, centaur, and dwarves were made of different blends of magical elements before they manifested into earthly bodies. The magical elements are Air, Earth, Water, and Fire.   
- *Magical Elements reference to Little Gidding by T.S. Eliot*   
-   
- Ash on an old man's sleeve  
- Is all the ash the burnt roses leave.  
- Dust in the air suspended  
- Marks the place where a story ended.  
- Dust inbreathed was a house-  
- The walls, the wainscot and the mouse,  
- The death of hope and despair,  
- This is the death of air.  
-   
- There are flood and drouth  
- Over the eyes and in the mouth,  
- Dead water and dead sand  
- Contending for the upper hand.  
- The parched eviscerate soil  
- Gapes at the vanity of toil,  
- Laughs without mirth.  
- This is the death of earth.  
-   
- Water and fire succeed  
- The town, the pasture and the weed.  
- Water and fire deride  
- The sacrifice that we denied.  
- Water and fire shall rot  
- The marred foundations we forgot,  
- Of sanctuary and choir.  
- This is the death of water and fire.  
-   
- Because Atticus is immune, battling the werewolf poses injury risk but not infection risk. Dwarves make good werewolf hunters because they can't be afflicted. Humans are hiring dwarves b/c of their resistance to the virus, and Centaurs who fell into law enforcement are good at rounding up werewolves due to their superior speed and size and immunity, so it’s an interesting social dynamic of humans exploiting minorities to do their dirty work. Also, werewolves can be identified by shining a certain type of torch in their eyes, but this is not common knowledge—it’s highly specialised criminal justice knowledge, and Clara could convince Yves that Zora is a Werewolf, and Yves gives her the special torch, but she doesn’t scan as a werewolf because she never took the bite, even though she pretends that she is one.

#### *Vampire Black Plague* 

- They got it under control with vaccines, but not everyone has taken one, so people still become Vampires. Also, there are some Vampire Supremacists who wish to convert all humans to their kind. Sort of like domestic terrorists calling for the Bugaboo, they would like to see a race war.  
- It’s spread by bats instead of rats; less widespread than the Black Death due to different population dispersions of bats vs. rats.

#### *Torture and Gang Violence in London*

- A cheap and effective way to torture someone was with the use of [rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_torture). There were many variants, but the most common was to force a rat through a victim's body (usually the intestines) as a way to escape. The victim would be completely restrained and tied to the ground or a bed, and the torturer would cut slits into the victim's stomach. The torturer would then use a bowl to trap rats on the victim's stomach, then place hot coal on top of the bowl; the rats would then get hot, and after a few seconds would enter the victim's stomach. Gnawing the intestines usually resulted in a few hours of pain for the victim. This almost always resulted in death.  
- The Richardson Gang was an English crime gang based in South London, England in the 1960s. Also known as the "Torture Gang", they had a reputation as some of London's most sadistic gangsters. Their alleged specialties included pulling teeth out using pliers, cutting off toes using bolt cutters and nailing victims to floors using 6-inch nails.  
- One of London’s most effective criminal gangs was the Forty Elephants, **an all-female crime syndicate**, which operated out of Southwark in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although they indulged in a wide variety of criminal activities, a particular speciality of theirs was shoplifting, which they often carried out wearing coats equipped with extra large or hidden pockets and hiding places for stolen items sewn in their underclothes. 

### **Character Backstory \-** 

#### *Police Force*

##### *General Notes*

- As ships \[at the [London docks](https://www.thehistoryoflondon.co.uk/the-new-london-docks-of-the-early-19th-century/)\] waited to unload, a significant proportion of cargo was stolen by gangs that preyed on the unguarded moored vessels. Goods standing on crowded and chaotic quaysides were also at risk from criminals, sometimes in collusion with customs officers. The magistrate, social reformer and statistician Patrick Colquhoun published his Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis in 1796 in which he proposed the creation of a police force for London. He was introduced to John Harriott who, understanding the scale of criminal activity on the river, proposed a specialist force. That led to the creation of the Marine Police Establishment, based at Wapping, the forerunner of London’s Metropolitan Police.  
- Most of the police forces of the United Kingdom use a [standardised set of ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_ranks_of_the_United_Kingdom), with a slight variation in the most senior ranks for the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police. Most of the British police ranks that exist today were chosen by Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel, the founder of the Metropolitan Police, enacted under the Metropolitan Police Act 1829\. The ranks at that time were deliberately chosen so that they did not correspond with military ranking (with the exception of sergeant), because of **fears of a paramilitary force**.  
- **Frederick George Abberline** (8 January 1843 – 10 December 1929\) \- a British Chief Inspector for the London Metropolitan Police. He is best known for being a prominent police figure in the investigation into the Jack the Ripper serial killer murders of 1888\.  
- Old Bailey — The Central Criminal Court of England and Wales, commonly referred to as the Old Bailey after the street on which it stands, is a criminal court building in central London, one of several that house the Crown Court of England and Wales. The street outside follows the route of the ancient wall around the City of London, which was part of the fortification's bailey, hence the metonymic name. A Metonymic is a figure of speech in which a thing or concept is referred to by the name of something closely associated with that thing or concept, and a bailey (or ward) in a [fortification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification) is a courtyard enclosed by a [curtain wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtain_wall_\(fortification\)). In particular, an early type of European castle was known as a [motte-and-bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey). [Castles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle) can have more than one bailey.  
- We will have something like “The Difference Engine’s” **Bow Street Special Branch** for the Whitechapel Murders narrative arc (mostly to do with Clara, but some Atticus overlap)  
- “While some policemen managed to ascend the police hierarchy and become senior officers with high wages, position of power, prestige and a respectable standing in the community at large, thereby crossing the boundary that divided the middle from the working class, the majority of officers (between 20% and 25% at the turn of the twentieth century) never rose beyond [the rank of constable](https://www2.clarku.edu/faculty/jbrown/papers/shpayer.pdf) and had to do with low wages, hard physical work, and no supervisory status.  
- **The Flying Squad** is a group of police officers who are always ready to travel quickly to the scene of a serious crime.  
- Beadle \- (historical) a minor parish officer dealing with petty offenders.

##### *Peter Kipling*

- Kipling’s thrown-out names: Donald Chumley Taffy Hathaway, Benjamin Treadaway, Edgar Oliphant, Bruce Milliken-Tetley, Swinley Crick

##### *The Soldier-turned-Cop (Centaur)*

- Yves (Eve) Chalamet-Duval, working closely with the stranger, blackmailing Clara into a search for the killer.

#### *The Dockhounds*

- The Dockhounds are the most powerful crime syndicate in our version of the Victorian East End of London. They specialize in “large-scale prostitution, forgery, counterfeiting, fraud, commercial burglary and money-laundering.” Many use their belts as weapons, sharpening the tin buckles into ‘a deadly flail.’  
- Ladsman \- A criminal teaching children how to steal in exchange for a cut of profits and/or other assistance such as safe lodging.

##### *Martina, ‘Molly’ of the Hounds*

- *Molly* was ‘long a synonym for "woman of ill repute," for unknown reasons.’ She is the [moll](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/moll), the mistress, the honcho of the Hounds, taking leadership after her husband was killed by a rival gang. She and Hounds avenged her husband by exterminating every last member of the rival gang, emerging from the bloody turf war victorious.  
- She has a weird half-shaved hairstyle and maybe some Eastern European-type background. Coming from a dysfunctional background, a coldness, hardness to her that she believes is 'in her blood' and can't really be unlearned, although she does have a deeply embedded soft spot, even after the tragedy of losing her love.

##### *The Ladsman*

- Carlisle McGrady, a 45 yo. deadbeat who used to be the ringleader of a band of pickpockets Atticus was involved with as a youth. He now resents Atticus for his debts to the Dockhounds, and Carlisle has a hard time recognizing Atticus if Atticus is wearing Sandhog Uniform

#### *The ‘Anglican’ [Cult](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1FACtrJausk4Gz0TfQKOXOEdBx5j07rzobqW_NvxGxr4/edit)*

- The [English Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation) took place in 16th-century England when the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. These events were, in part, associated with the wider European Protestant Reformation, a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity in western and central Europe. Causes included the invention of the printing press, increased circulation of the Bible and the transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars, the upper and middle classes and readers in general. The phases of the English Reformation, which also covered Wales and Ireland, were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself.  
- Evangelicalism \- worldwide trans-denominational movement within Protestant Christianity   
- During the 19th century, the megachurches, churches with more than 2,000 people, began to develop. The first [evangelical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism#18th_century) megachurch, the Metropolitan Tabernacle with a 6000-seat auditorium, was inaugurated in 1861 in London by Charles Spurgeon.  
- Name Ideas: "The People Risen” (from The Difference Engine)  
- Moloch \- an  idol with the head of a Bull that appears in the book of Leviticus, and seems to involve child sacrifice. "In Greek mythology, the people of Athens were at one point compelled by King Minos to choose 14 young noble citizens (seven young men and seven maidens) to be offered as sacrificial victims to the Minotaur to be killed in retribution for the death of Minos' son…” Throughout the game, the Cult is aware of Atticus and maybe helps him on certain missions/allows Atticus to live, with a plan to use Atticus and the orphans in a type of sacrificial ceremony to give the Cult leader the Power of Moloch, or, alternatively, to mechanise Atticus with enhancements, and create a Moloch-Minotaur-zombie that would be a super-soldier for the Cult. Moloch was a bull-headed deity associated with child sacrifice, which is a practice Bragg is already familiar with, having orchestrated the string of kidnappings in the East End, to fuel his experimental body-modification. In his vision of the future, Bragg hopes to mechanise Atticus with enhancements, and use the minotaur’s abilities for the interests of the Cult.

##### *The Cult Leader*

- Crippled in his youth, this Belgian (?) Cyclops inherited a boatload of money, with which he created a mechanical ventilation system to sustain his body/lungs/respiratory system, and to be able to live longer in general. During a sacrificial ceremony, he should wear a Surplice. He isn't evil so much as a victim of his upbringing and circumstance that perverted his world view.  
- Being a Cyclops gives us freedom to say that he’s capable of magic, etc.  
- The leader could be hoping to set people free from their neuroses… saying the mind is just a tool, a machine that if used properly, can evolve humanity, instead of obsessing over the impossible task of solving inner issues (a la Untethered Soul, page 95\)  
- Crossover with Clara: Clara had to flee an abusive and controlling relationship with her French husband, slowly poisoning him to death by putting a little bit of arsenic from rat poison each day into his morning tea. She then fled to Belgium (spent a few years in Brussels, learning the ropes as a con-artist, where she also met the Belgian Cult Leader coincidentally—running in the same underground circles), then to the Netherlands and finally to England to escape prosecution.  
- Potential names: Richard or **Silas Braxton Bragg**, Ryzer Hackel or Rysher or Rycher, Gustave Ruscha, **Stryver Cole**, Gustave Ryzer

#### *Clara Reed / (Corsair)*

- Previous potential names \- Lacey Virgeaux, Margeaux McCall, Margot Virgeaux, **Heyward**  
- Potential [Romantic Operas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bohemian_Girl)/[Comic Operas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorcerer) \- [burlesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_burlesque) [ballad opera](https://www.jstor.org/stable/739642?seq=1).  
- A redeemable thief with a heart of gold… or a reluctant hero. Her potential mortality comes more from the people she's investigating—she's getting close to something or someone big, and they don't want her finding out.  
- In the Bar-chat with Atticus, the Player can say what Clara says from the opposite side of the Conversation (her POV this time) and it's like a 'Choose to Rob the Minotaur' or not sort of moment. But if we start her storyline chronologically AFTER she robs Atticus, there won't be any programming issues as far as Atticus/Clara interfacing.  
- Prison opening for her game (?) \- A treadwheel, or treadmill, is a form of engine typically powered by humans. It may resemble a water wheel in appearance, and can be worked either by a human treading paddles set into its circumference (treadmill), or by a human or animal standing inside it (treadwheel). These devices are no longer used for power or punishment, and the term "treadmill" has come to mean an exercise machine for running or walking in place.  
- She was an amateur star-gazer and dreamt of becoming an astronomer before her toxic relationship and fall from grace, so she has a little telescope set up in her tenement window that she got secondhand and repaired herself. There’s an eyewitness in her same building that in one mission she has to get to talk. She has her telescope pointed to the stars depending on the Astrological season, which she’s also into (Astrology being Astronomy’s kooky cousin). She also collects various ocular oddities such as a spyglass used by sailors and explorers, among other ocular curiosities.   
- She was in some kind of abusive/controlling relationship with her French husband, and she had to slowly poison (by putting a little bit of arsenic from rat poison each day into his morning tea). She then fled to Belgium (spent a few years in Brussels, learning the ropes as a con-artist, where she also met the Belgian Cult Leader coincidentally—running in the same underground circles), then to the Netherlands and finally to England to escape prosecution. Since then she’s assumed a new identity and has been in and out of jail, and ridden trains and gypsy caravans over from France and throughout England, Scotland and Ireland, sharpening her skills as a thief and finally a sex-worker when she settled in London, for the high-paying clientele she attracts with her well-travelled personality and wealth of intelligence and stories to tell.   
- Motivation to solve the mystery: Sympathy for the women and fear of being targeted herself; but also a detective character (a friend of the Stranger’s) approaches her early on in the game, showing her gruesome crime scene photos and case files, then offering a handsome sum for her to go undercover in hopes to catch the killer. The detective is an old police acquaintance who initially strong-arms her into it but the deeper into it she gets the more it bothers her and she gets this drive to solve the case on her own. She became an informant after her troubles with the law, so the detective (a man) kind of blackmails her or otherwise forces her hand but she realises she actually wants to help after a while. There’s also a Centaur Soldier-turned-Cop who still rocks his full regalia and has a bit of a narcissist/power-trip complex, but with a heart of gold once he reels in his ego. Seeing as there will be so much Police-work, he could even be the Precinct Manager for the 'Detective' character who convinces Clara to try and solve the case. He has a thing for Clara but she rebuffs him and manipulates him. He thinks he's a ladies man but he's full of himself, and being a little too clumsy for a soldier, he moved into police work instead.  
- Clara visits the bridge of sighs as a crime scene and converses with a spirit of a woman who committed "suicide" under mysterious circumstances. (See UTB as reference)  
- **TUNING IN** MECHANIC \- Before interactions with NPCs, Clara can start to sense the energetic auras of the other players. You get a sense immediately of the level of their anxiety, their Vigour and Nerve readings appear on the UI, and this helps with persuasion and other skill checks, as well as increases the RNG odds of winning more money from the players throughout the game. \*But should we allow the Player the option of NOT ‘tuning-in?’ My gut says that the Player should be able to argue with Clara’s own internal spirit guide (who?) but eventually is convinced, just because ‘tuning-in’ could then become something of a repeat experience throughout the game, giving her better odds at persuasion, or making it easier to make the NPC believe Clara's lies, for example.  
- She turns on a steam-pore-purifier in her dressing room as part of her evening routine.  
- Clara can interact more with the dog and cat in Sorris Square.  
- She’s at the Police Precinct, on the arm of a dandy (Tenor Cunningham) at the werewolf fights—maybe to investigate the suspect (Sykes), and at the pub with the Dockhounds.

#### *Anselina Kemény (Curiosities Shoppe Owner)*

- Potential first names \- Clementina (means mild or merciful), Tamásina (my take on the male name Tamás—not sure if accurate), Anselina / Ethelinda / Esmerelda / Rosella / Theodosia / Tillie (shortened from Matilda), Selina / Sabina / Mizelli / Queenie / Penelope (Penny), Hezekiah (actually a man’s name), Vanda (altered from Bulgarian surname), Vida (a Hungarian surname)  
- Potential surnames \- Roma: Lakatos / Orsós / Tanács / János / Kemény / Pálóczi

  Bosnian: Delić / Popović / Durić / Jović / Ćorić / Marković

  Bulgarian: Angelov / Balakov / Borkov / Chernov /  Emilov / Gudakov / Makarov / Mitkov / Rakovski / Romanov / Ruskov / Semakov / Slovenov / Starkov / Vaganov / Vandalov / Yushkov

  Hungarian: Bandy / Barsi / Bartos / Bender / Bordas / Brody / Bunda / Damiani / Demeter / Deveny / Fabiani / Igo / Joost / Kadar / Kamara / Karoly / Kiraly / Kemeny / Kontos / Silvas / Tamasi / Voros

  Misc: Babka (a sort of bread from Jewish communities in Poland and Ukraine)

- Others (full names): Sophia Boswell, Ashena Lee, Anselina Cooper. Rosella Buckland, Sinfi Lovell

#### *The Masked Stranger*

##### *His Motivations — Slowly revealed the Player:*

- The stranger sought you out because not many Minotaurs can do magic anymore. The magical bloodlines have died off, for a reason we find out by the end of the story. The more observant players will be able to put together a strong hypothesis near the final mission, but it cannot be confirmed until the ‘Big Reveal.’  
- He puts you under hypnosis while you’re in the opium dream.  
- Since society hasn’t not been accepting Minotaurs, some who embrace the darkness of being lonely, or are forced into such a life like Atticus, develop magic as a psychic coping mechanism. Their brain chemistry opens in certain pathways that ‘well-adjusted’ Minotaurs don’t develop. They need to be in considerable isolation to develop magical abilities. Like Atticus did in the orphanage having suffered bullying, and much like the legendary Greek Minoatar did, confined to his Labyrinth. Since there isn’t a mainstream culture for this sort of isolated-upbringing, that’s why there aren’t many magical Minotaurs left.   
- Besides, the high-class minotaur families that still exist would rather raise their children and be a part of their lives, teaching them the simple illusion of making them look human, rather than raise them in isolation, even if it would make them more magically powerful. There are of course exceptions to the rule, and Atticus has heard of the famous magical Minotaur families. But the stranger has to tell him about why they became so magical. And why this was dark magic, because magic in isolation typically leads to darkness, which is also why society has shunned minotaurs. They don’t count the cost, and the more sociopathic they are, the more powerful they tended to be throughout history. Which made them powerful allies in the world of crime, but now that most crime has gone underground and white collar, and big governments have cracked down, the minotaur crime-lords have long since been killed off by the other races. In a similar way to how the dragons were slayed to prevent a reign of terror. 

#### 

#### *Teddy Redgrave (Dwarf Mechanic & Inventor)*

- Old names \- Cotton Redgrave, Perry Flanagan, William (Willy) Redwick, Cillian Flynn, Oliver Healy, Theodore (Teddy) Redcap, Patton O’Leary, Wilfred McMillan. Radcliffe McCall, Cotton O’Malley, Cotton O’Connor, Milton Redwick, Oliver Redding, Quigley Moran, Sweeney O’Connor, Flannery Bobbit, Flannery Redfoot, Sweeney O’Donahue, Sweeney O’Sullivan (Sully for short)   
- Dwarf character sheet \- [https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/dwarf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/dwarf)   
- [ ] Coal-mining mission? Save an orphan from the harsh labour of the [mines](https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/child-labour)?  
- [ ] Clocktower Mission Side-Quest with ‘Tesla’ character AKA Dante — He’s trying to run the clocktower on AC power which he hopes to gather from the Ionosphere after converting the top of the Tower to something like the [Wardenclyffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower). But, he’s being \*steamrolled\* by an ‘Edison’ character and the Industrialists/Royals. Teddy has a choice (that Dante tells him could change the course of history) to either help with the Clocktower or not, aligning himself with either ‘Tesla’ or ‘Edison’.

#### 

#### *Otto the Automaton* 

- For his ‘Vigour’ dynamic, maybe he needs to be wound-up now and then or his energy gets low, and he can only do this with his friends, or pay for the service at specific locations, or self-wind (but this takes some time--like maybe the equivalent of a ‘short rest’ in D\&D)  
- It’s a Duo game with Teddy (like Kitsuragi and main player in Disco Elysium), or like Army of Two  
- The stray dog in Sorris Square is scared of Otto’s mechanisms.  
- An Electro-plating section of the Magic Shoppe — where a Nicola-Tesla type person does the process (see notes above) — Otto wonders if he might get electro-plated to take more damage. Oh no\! The proprietor says, “This is a process only for the preservation of Human bodies. Automatons are strictly forbidden from tainting such a time-honoured tradition.”  
- The Broken Clocktower is a Quest in this game, with mini-game puzzles where you have to fit the right cogs together to fix the mechanisms.

#### *Atticus Daley*

- Ungulates \-  members of a diverse clade of primarily large mammals with hooves. These include odd-toed ungulates such as horses, rhinoceroses and tapirs, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, sheep, deer, and hippopotamuses. M*embers of a diverse clade of primarily large mammals with hooves. These include odd-toed ungulates such as horses, rhinoceroses and tapirs, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, sheep, deer, and hippopotamuses.*  
- *Clade \- a group of organisms believed to have evolved from a common ancestor, according to the principles of cladistics.*  
- Those who don't care for him may call him an ungulate. We can also call him a Chordate because he has a tail.  
- Our Minotaurs use horns as close range weapons, they’re light sensitive and have an innate sense of direction. Size and strength above average vs. human.  
- Christina \- A separate love interest, giving Atticus personal interest in the case, rather than Clara's more general motive; also the dead body that Atticus finds in

#### 

#### *Sister Susanna Haverford*

- Used to be Eleanor Everdeen / Elford, or Susanna Partridge; see [Supporting Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_UrwJEknvjy53HJSvydu3EdO5AjJjdOqZt5ZF9o740/edit?usp=sharing)  
- After so many years of Father Franco's physical (we've decided to avoid any mention of sexual abuse) abuse of the children, bad spirits have found their way into the orphanage, and Everdeen is sort of a perpetually scared, worn-out but good-at-heart character. She's paranoid having dealt with Father Franco, who has since moved away from the orphanage and into a higher position in the Clergy, leaving Everdeen to manage the orphanage. The numbers of orphans have dwindled, partly due to other orphanages being built in the area, but a majority due to Father Franco being in cahoots with this Cult that's obsessed with steampunk-style body-modification and eternal-life chasing, by way of organ-harvesting and occult experiments/borderline witchcraft. They are harvesting organs from the orphans, since they have no family and are easily prey, and Franco, along with the Dockhounds (most powerful gang in the East End) are involved in the organ-market, since the upper class paying top dollar for these organs (used for weird operations and human enhancements, as well as actual organ replacements for rich people with bad livers, etc.) The leader of the Cult is the principal antagonist for the whole Sovereign Syndicate (the team that the M.S. assembles \-- Teddy, Clara, included), and the Cult is trying to usurp the Crown's power by way of infiltrating the Christian church. So... Everdeen is short-tempered and her nerves are worn thin. She's seen a lot of tragedy with her orphans disappearing, and suspecting Franco but also not really knowing how to confront him, because she fears for her own life, and she knows about the Cult's influence, but will refuse to discuss it with the Player. The Cult has a kind 'Eyes Wide Shut' feel to it, the Cult leader having been crippled in his youth, but inheriting a boatload of money, which he then used smartly to build more wealth, and he rides around in a tricked-out steampunk wheelchair with all these mechanical augmentations and weaponry. Think of Susanna as Jessica Lange in AHS Asylum... I'm super open to changing her character, too, so maybe she's in with Franco on the orphan harvesting, like maybe in a Walter-White sort of way, *she breaks bad because she needs a liver* or something, and there was this one terrible orphan (maybe a character like Jimmy Marker, Atticus's tormentor) who she just got fed up with and sold to the Cult so she could get his organ. But IDK that could be going too far.  
- \*Crown being the British Crown and the real (historically) Parliament / British Govt.

#### *Eustace Fullivole*

##### *Cragside Notes (Reference for the “Fullivole” Manor)*

- The Manor lies and was built “on the side of a moorland crag.”  
- Shooting box \- chiefly British: cabin/small house in the country for use in the shooting season.  
- He hired a Scottish architect called R. Norman Shaw, \[and\] Cragside became the centre of Armstrong's world; reminiscing years later, in his old age, he remarked, "had there been no Cragside, I shouldn't be talking to you today – for it has been my very life"  
- Shaw sketched out the whole design for the "**future fairy palace**" in a single afternoon, while Armstrong and his guests were out on a shooting party. After this rapid initial design, Shaw worked on building the house for over 20 years. The long building period, and Armstrong's **piecemeal, and changeable,** approach to the development of the house, and his desire to retain the original shooting lodge at its core, occasionally led to tensions between client and architect, and to a building that lacks an overall unity.  
- Shaw made sure Cragside was composed "with memorable force"  
- In August 1884 the Prince and Princess of Wales (the future Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) made a three-day visit to Cragside; it was the peak of Armstrong's social career. **The royal arrival at the house was illuminated by ten thousand lamps and a vast array of Chinese lanterns hung in the trees on the estate; fireworks were launched from six balloons, and a great bonfire was lit on the Simonside Hills.**  
- \[In 1887\] at the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, Armstrong was ennobled as Baron Armstrong of Cragside, and became the first engineer and the first scientist to be granted a peerage. Armstrong died at Cragside on 27 December 1900, aged 90, and was buried beside his wife in the churchyard at Rothbury.  
- Located in [Ottershaw](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ottershaw,+UK/@51.3814073,-0.5563589,11.8z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x487dfb409284ffd1:0x29283750cdaba67f!2sNational+Trust+-+Cragside!8m2!3d55.3173625!4d-1.8939049!3m4!1s0x487677a538e09d8f:0x5fadfe5a6be0f3f7!8m2!3d51.3633942!4d-0.5303049)?

##### *Craigdarroch Castle in Canada  \- [A comprehensive Tour](http://tour.thecastle.ca/tour)*

- Isaac’s memory \- “outside the downtown core on a large plot of land (something like 28 acres originally it says) up on a hill with great views overlooking the city. Large gardens, outbuildings for maids quarters, support staff, gardener, etc. really intricate wood and stone work, stained glass windows”  
- [It’s haunted](https://npiweb.com/Blog/Posts/haunted-places-series-craigdarroch-castle). [Probably](https://mysterioustrip.com/craigdarroch-castle-victoria/)…  
- Based on Craigdarroch castle. Built by coal baron \[Vancouver Island coal\] Robert Dunsmuir during the reign of Queen Victoria, \[...\] Robert and Joan Dunsmuir had two sons, eight daughters and plenty of exploits.   
- Victorian society was highly stratified into upper, lower and middle classes. Craigdarroch was home to individuals whose great wealth was predicated on the efforts of the working class, but also the workplace of a number of servants. The Castle was designed to keep these two spheres separate, and yet close enough that the servants were always on hand to assist the family.

#### *The [Ratcatcher](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfUzZTXY6pG3hJjKmA0Qb7MIzEIlPKZfKE5WH6_OvgE/edit)*

- “...Jack Black became synonymous with the profession of a [ratcatcher](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/11/09/ratcatchers-victorian-age/#:~:text=The%20people%20involved%20in%20this,sometimes%20using%20traps%20or%20dogs.). But he wasn’t only known for his ability to efficiently kill rats. Black was the pioneer of a fad that became popular across Victorian England in the mid-19th century―**the fancy rat. In his ventures, Black would always be on \[the\] lookout for peculiar colored rats**, which he would then sell on as pets. The culture of breeding rats was, at the time, related to rat-baiting―a blood sport in which a group of rats was released in a pit, together with a dog, who would then chase them, and eventually kill them”  
- The pastime of [rat-baiting](https://www.ozy.com/true-and-stories/the-other-jack-black-and-his-rat-friends/250037/) eventually became so lucrative that the London government put a tax on rat-killing dogs.  
- The ratcatcher has a little cellar in Sorris Square which is his home and office, with an entrance to the Underground locomotive-tunnels.

#### *The Stray Dog (Sorris Square)*

- Blue merle collies were originally known as tortoise-shell to describe their colour.  
- Queen Victoria’s deep and abiding love for Scotland made a lasting impact on the Collie’s history. It was the dog-loving Victoria, during her many extended stays at Balmoral Castle on the Scottish Highlands, who popularised the local herding breed among her courtiers and subjects during the second half of the 19th century. Her enthusiasm for Collies began the breed’s ascent from humble shepherd dog to worldwide canine superstar.  
- It is supposed that the Collie’s ancestors reached Scotland nearly 2,000 years before Victoria did, brought by the Romans during their conquest of Britain in the first century of the Common Era. Over several centuries, the Roman herding stock was interbred with local dogs. Sometime during this long unwritten history, we can surmise that a stouthearted sheepherding dog recognizable as the Collie came into focus. (A prevalent theory holds that the name Collie derives from the name of a particular strain of black-faced sheep called colleys.)  
- The Collie enters the written record around 1800, and by the time Victoria “discovered” the Collie later in the century, the breed’s now familiar characteristics were set. The Collie was a working dog breed developed in Great Britain, probably by the 18th century. There are two varieties: the rough-coated, originally used to guard and herd sheep, and the smooth-coated, used mainly to drive livestock to market. Collies are lithe dogs with tapering heads, almond-shaped eyes, and erect ears that tip forward at the ends. Both varieties are identical in form, although some authorities believe they were once distinct breeds. The rough-coated collie, a popular companion and watchdog, has a thick, straight coat that forms a heavy ruff about its neck and throat; the smooth-coated collie has a dense, smooth coat.  
- Border collie, breed of herding dog, typically an outstanding sheepdog, which has been used along the English-Scottish border for about 300 years. Considered among the most intelligent breeds, border collies also excel at agility competitions.  
- Bearded collie, a dog breed developed in Great Britain for herding sheep and driving cattle to market, is one the oldest British breeds, and its ancestors may have included herding dogs from the Continent. The bearded collie is a medium-sized dog covered with a long, shaggy coat covering even the hanging ears, tail, legs, and muzzle (hence, bearded); its long eyebrows blend into the coat on the head.

#### *Extra NPC Names and Location Names to Use*

- Harper, Partridge, Emily Cole, Connell Ramsey  
- Mendy \- primarily a female name of American origin that means Black And Beautiful. Originally a nickname for Melinda, it is often now used as a formal name on its own.  
- Cult Leader: **Silas / Richard Braxton Bragg**, (Ryzer Hackel / Rysher / Rycher \_\_\_ or Gustave Ruscha \- Our Belgian Cyclops Cult Leader), Stryver Cole, Gustave Ryzer   
- “Floyd Gondoli, Jimmy Gator, Mumbles O’Malley” (taken directly from “Hard Eight” by Paul Thomas Anderson)  
- **A “Red Herring” character** who will guide us through the hidden entrance to the catacombs, looking for The Sceptre of Midas, a ‘forbidden relic.’ (this was an old idea… but now our Red Herring is Sykes) Ms. Penelope (Penny) Direksyon. Ms. Penny Drexyon. Talika (Tally) D’Rakshin, Jessika D’Rekshin… (As in: ‘Misdirection’)  
- Clancy Wainwright (used in the Hatch for the Warden, could work for Sanitarium)  
- A character named Lamsey...? *playing off Ramsey. Lamsey Cunningham or Lamsey McClain.*  
- Pegurim \- a rural location imbued with Magick. The Witch Doctor goes there to get away from the city and recharge. Or else, it’s one of the Machine-Building companies, or an area of London where a lot of the Engines are built… or even better, the name of the offshore floating prison on a steamship the size of a battle cruiser.

##### *Skills / Skill Set / Points / Attributes / Affiliation Notes*

- Patience AKA Understanding of Human & Worldly Flaws (willing to wait for a problem to resolve itself) \[for OG stats — equivalent to Self Discipline\]  
- Insight AKA Empathy (predicting what characters will say if you say ‘this’)  
- Charity AKA Compassion (willingness to help others, this helps b/c ‘what goes around comes around’)  
- Persuasion (talk your way through, lying if necessary)  
- Integrity AKA Honesty (makes you seem reliable to NPCs)  
- Sleight of Hand (lock picking, dexterity, deftness with small tools/games)


*RE: Patience \-- I like the idea of Patience as a virtue for Atticus in his battle with vices, so that 'waiting for something to happen' is an asset throughout the game... and this skill could improve for example when he has to wait for the police to finish their investigation, and he walks away, only to fall again when he goes down to the Inferno Gambling Parlor*

### **Notes from Youtube (Instructional & Inspirational Videos) \-** 

#### [*Choice*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FfITxaXeqM)*, Complicity, and Consequence*

- Choice, obvious, complicity — the emotional experience during a choice, and consequence, obvious  
- Many types of consequences, such as narrative, gameplay and deferred (Failbetter likes to warn players about these, but not all studios do)  
- Write choices that align with, comment on, unpack the Theme  
- If you can express/render down a ton of backstory in a way that’s immediately emotionally engaging, then that’s a good Choice  
- Ludonarrative dissonance \- the conflict between a video game's narrative told through the story and the narrative told through the gameplay. Ludonarrative, a compound of ludology and narrative, refers to the intersection in a video game of ludic elements and narrative elements. Ludic meaning ‘of play,’ and meaning of the gameplay, here.  
- 2, 3, 5 Choices: 2 \- to be or not to be (dramatic, elegant); 3 \- left, right, straight (the third choice comments on the first two); 5 is better than 4 (it feels generous, and you can lock or two of them with variables, with making Player feel restricted)  
- Don’t write yourself too many Content Checks that you can’t pay.  
- In Fallen London, you get 47 justifications for how entered a selective Member’s Club  
- Some argue that choices shown, but unavailable takes you out of Immersion  
- Dictating a Player’s emotional state is a **missed opportunity**. Try not to do this so much/cut it down in the rewrite process with Scott.

![][image4]

- If you replace the ‘be humbled’ prompt with a ‘take action’ prompt that’s related to the corresponding set of feelings, you add colour, and the player already knows how they feel when they make the choice, you don't have to spell it out  
- You can have your body hollowed out after joining a cult, but it makes no gameplay difference. This creates a ‘fantasy of failure’ which people love.  
- The game is what happens inside your player’s head, not what happens in the code or script. If the player doesn’t notice a consequence, it doesn’t happen. Don’t just spray choice and consequence all over, even as an indie dev full of piss and vinegar. **The more choice/consequence you have in your game, the less players care about any given one.** Quantity/Quality  
- “A \[title\] of your quality (dictated by variable)  
- Find the common factors in your story — “the stokers smoulder” every time there’s combat, this is repeatable yet continuously evocative  
- **Underspecified narrative** — START USING THIS TERM. It’s when you leave space for the players to interpret/insert their own thoughts and feelings, so they co-own the narrative for much greater attachment. Write as much as you need to get in, then get out of the way  
- “...it is with words as with sunbeams \- the more they are condensed the deeper they burn.” — Southey  
- “Whatever you can communicate sufficiently in game mechanic, you should put it there instead of in text.” — Emily Short  
- Resist the urge to solve a design flaw with text. Players don’t pay you by word. Game mechanics are a way to allow the player to cooperate with you.   
- Resources should be dependent on the theme, even if it’s just the amount of time spent playing. Don’t have dozens, and have the few carry symbolic/emotional weight  
- Make it appear that the game is *paying attention* to the player.  
- Construct an outline that’s like fires in the desert, and the paths the player navigates between the points will belong to them.

#### [*Everything's on Fire*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POgN1VN3e3k) *and No One Knows What to Do (In Game Writing)*

- 3 min — What we do we can only do with the help of the Programmers, the Artists, with the help of QA. I love telling stories, and I want everyone to feel the same way. It’s disheartening to hear when someone says ‘eh, it’s a paycheck.’ … Oh… but this is my baby :)  
- If they are not involved, then we might as well be writing novels.  
- 4:49 Game writing is a bridge between what the designers intended and what stories the Players are telling themselves. (The Designers have an overarching idea of what’s possible, the writers get to lead the Player through what story they themselves (personal QOL) along the way.  
- Emerging narrative \- 50% of the story is being told in the Player’s head. It’s a more personal story than the Writer can tell (because we’re writing for a wider audience)  
- The Player is telling the story with you  
- A narrative bug is a very real thing  
- Story vs. Setting (which would be there if the Player didn’t exist)  
- Just because you have one, doesn’t mean you have the other  
- When you’re down in the thick of writing, you’re just seeing tree, tree, tree, and it’s hard to see the forest.  
- Artists will provide insights into characters that we never knew we were lacking.  
- Pick your battles — what’s crucial? Also, don’t shut anyone down, because they might not come back to you with a new idea later on.  
- Watch out for your ego, when you’ve worked on something super hard and it still doesn’t resonate  
- Rule of Three — it’s okay if one person critiques something, but when you’ve gotten the same note from three people, then there’s a real problem  
- Think of everything you’re writing as incomplete — the Story is a sculpture.  
- Near completion, don’t hesitate to push back, but do it in the language of the Producers.  
- It’s important to ask *why* things are changing… bring in a Focus Test to check and see if the creators are just getting weary of their own content, and hence forcing an unnecessary amount of changes.  
- Write like a Designer and vice-versa: **Floating NPC’s** — Can be used interchangeably and moved levels without compromising the integrity of the Quest. It will still work just as well, whether NPCx is in this level or the next one.   
- Narrative vs. Level-flow — Can you remove the Story, write the Level-flow first, including the major beats, then fill in the gaps.  
- Create a Critical Path document (complete with floating NPC’s), because the chances are that the game will get re-scoped. USE A FLOW CHART  
- Ambition is quite often the enemy of reality  
- Re-pacing and re-scoping is an important part of the process towards the end, b/c let’s face it, we’re writers, and we tend to write long.  
- Make a list of all the Gameplay Spaces we’ve already created (and can be slightly adjusted and still used to add to the game) EX: ‘Rome’ becomes ‘Rome at night’  
- What parts of the Story are important to be delivered and WHEN?  
- Expose the Questions\! Otherwise the writer is just asking them to themselves… (This \*should\* give Questioner-type Personalities something of an advantage to lean into, if moderated well)  
- Follow the suboptimal paths through your dialogues — not just the one you would choose and would make the most sense.   
- Enjoy fixing bugs — like little crunchy treats at the end — feels good to smash-em. Don’t be afraid to say ‘Will not Fix’ or ‘Working as Intended’  
- If Players are skipping Dialog, try to build in Tutorialization throughout the game to reinforce the points you were trying to hit.  
- Lean on the Journal UI (so anything critical that came in dialog is replicated there, too)  
- Get creative with tutorialization — reiterate learned skills/how to use items via Gameplay and Visuals (a la the Half-Life 2 Silent Tutorial)  
- Make sure the choices you offer have a lot of reactivity — so with a limited budget, you might only be able to have 4 or so ‘Big Choices,’ but for those Big Choices, pay the heck back on them… make sure you milk them for all the reactivity they have to offer. And draw attention to the strategic Choice-Branching you designed and wrote for. You can literally say — because you killed that guy, that’s why I’m coming after you now. Sometimes drawing attention to the choice multiple times will make sure more Players realise the amount of control they actually did have, and the results their choices brought about.   
- Some branching choices will move toward ‘Choke-Points’ — big moments that ALL Players will get to, and thereby will be more useful to write. They will make it through the edits, because they hold up the storyline.  
- Can you make the Reactivity systemic and yet still narrative based — so for example, no matter what Dialog choice you make, it affects your character’s Affiliation  
- Write a summary of the game, then write the game, then see if it still matches the initial summary… but I’m not sure about this advice, because I like the option to change things.

#### [*Writing ‘Nothing’*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPkbAMj-xVA)

- Keep the compression while adding complexity  
- The Player should be Actively Listening (so try adding more subtext — internal questions the characters might be asking themselves, or lies they’re telling themselves)  
- One type — a ‘mechanics-driven’ game  
- Omissions:   
  - Use contrast to express the inexpressible  
  - As you start practising this (don’t forget to add ellipses for the actors)  
  - EX: Do you think we’ll make it through to ‘till dawn?  
  - ~~I don’t know, but we’ll try.~~  
  - I… We’ll try.  
- Apparent Non-sequiturs:  
  - EX: Do you think we’ll make it through to ‘till dawn?  
  - I… \[Subtext — silence covering her fear\] Don’t forget your coat, it looks like rain in the morning.  
  - Even in games about shooting Zombies, there’s still some love (in) there.  
- Unreliable Narrators:  
  - Add some uncertainty to etch-out the priorities of the characters, but don’t overuse them, because they can seem like ‘Clues’ but are Red Herrings  
  - Self-deception (when obvious to the Player) will allow the Player to appreciate the impending Self-Discovery — relevant to Atticus’s story  
- Go Beyond Script — Animation, Voice Acting, Environmental (Art Design), Interactables and Interfacing, Marketing (give clues about the Story outside the Game itself)

#### [*Side Quests*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTJ_RjfhGVQ)

- Convenient to accept and woven into main story; letting player choose what they want to see makes more players satisfied in the end  
- Types — story driven, variety driven, elaboration driven, and challenge driven  
- Story — attached to Main Quest, but not necessary to finish the game  
- Variety — adds weirdness and flair; a palate cleanser  
- Challenge-driven — such as optional ‘super-boss’ battles

#### 

#### *Quest Design ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otAkP5VjIv8) & [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur6GQp5mCYs))*

- Common types — kill, fetch, fed-ex, collect, escort (with NPC)  
- Most are used to direct the Player through the experience (teach you how to play, mechanics, etc.)  
- Make them story-driven and advantageous to the Player in later acts (if: found Orphans, then Molly is impressed at the Tavern, for example, or if: CourtesanKiller, then Clara doesn’t rob you *entirely* blind)  
- Ex: follow the sewer caps — suddenly this part of the world that the Player has run over many times are part of the lore of the world; then a puzzle makes them think of places on the map under new terms, such as the Town Hall being the ‘seat of power’  
- The sewer caps have to be textured either way. What's the extra cost of making them shine a bit?  
- Environmental quests — such as Missing Poster, make the world feel holistic and alive

#### *Quests and Rewards*

- Overjustification effect \- when offering a reward ends up reducing the intrinsic motivation to perform an action. (such as test subjects that already like drawing being less motivated to do so when they are given a reward for it, compared to a group that was not given a reward) The journey is the destination, the reward is in the process, etc., like when I began enjoying film work as I started to associated it more with payment  
- However, the Unexpected Reward avoids falling victim to this effect. This group of subjects drew slightly more/better pictures than the group receiving no reward at all, so GIVE PLAYERS UNEXPECTED SURPRISE REWARDS  
- Better to use large, overarching goals that players can complete however they want, rather than restrictive, step by step instructions (allowing design to focus on comparative metrics like leaderboards, histograms, and personal bests)

#### *Sidequests*

- Types: Kill, Delivery, Fetch, Escort (protect someone), Collection (like our Gin Collector), Investigation, Defensive (plants vs. zombies), Gather, Hybrid, Push the Button, Mystery, Lore

  #### *Do [Good Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DWdnoLosZ8) When You Don't Know What to Do*

- Ruth Tomandl — love/hate with ambiguity: when you don’t have enough info to make good decisions; this is not risk, which is when you bet on something but at least you know the odds  
- Game Devs face ambiguity ALL the time in decisions; if you’re doing something NEW, then you should obviously be facing ambiguity  
- Getting the right work done (prioritisation, driving decisions, scheduling and tasking, owning deadlines); seek a viable, compelling, clear and well communicated shared vision.   
- Issues — churn without progress, feature creep, team anxiety, resentment/blame and indecision  
- 14:55
