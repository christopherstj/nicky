Complete,02_03B - The Silver Coin,The Silver Coin,2,Mission,Manor,"You are welcomed into an austere manor by a man named Alphonse. ""Thank you for coming. I lead The Silver Coin, a werewolf preservation society. The Howling Twins are besmirching the name of decorous werewolves. We cannot coexist with the citizens of London when so many of our kind are attacking recklessly. You must stop the Howling Twins so that societies like mine can continue our work.""","<Agree to Help>
You point out that werewolves, when properly self-regulated, deserve the same rights as any species. You will attempt to restore honour to the Silver Coin by eliminating the Howling Twins and any other vukasin you come across who cannot control their violent urges. Alphonse's eyes brighten. ""Thank you, citizen. Your efforts shall not go unnoticed. In fact, please accept this payment in advance.""
<Gain 150 Money>","<Demand Payment>
You insist that your services be rewarded with capital. Alphonse silently considers this. Finally, he says, ""All right. I should hope this is enough."" 
<Gain 100 Money>","<Disagree on Principle>
You argue that werewolves are dangerous and unpredictable. Claiming that they will never mesh with civilized society, you say you will stop the Howling Twins, but not for Alphonse's benefit. There's a flash of silver in Alphonse's eyes before he says, ""Very well, then. I will seek supporters elsewhere."" You take your leave, never to return.",
Complete,02_10A - The Bone Mill,The Bone Mill,2,Mission,Factory Interior,"You follow the wires to the floor of a cavernous factory. Piles of bones cover up the copper conduits, leading to an office where business was orchestrated. Crows fly in through the shattered windows, tearing into hatcheted bodies at your feet, while the rats feast on entrails scattered across the work belts. ","<Search the Office> A massive machine with sparking electric coils is bolted to the back wall, and a scribbled note sits atop the desk. ""The Professor shall have all the components he needs! And all we had to do was funnel the poorhouse dead to this abandoned factory. Chop, chop! Job's a good'un. But I don't understand how the generator works."" Suddenly, the smell of burning oil fills the air, and you're surrounded by mechanised enemies.
<Fight Vayne's Automatons>","<Investigate the Machinery> Following the sound of arcing electricity, you discover a massive generator in the office. A metal chute is bolted to the top, spattered with gore and what appears to be bone dust. Beside the chute on the shelf is something that is still useful. Before you can ponder the workings of the machine, you hear the sound of clanking footsteps and are surrounded by mechanised enemies.
